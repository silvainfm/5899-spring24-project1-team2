Filed on Wednesday by its German and Dutch subsidiary companies at the European general court in Luxembourg, the company‚Äö√Ñ√¥s lawsuit challenges Brussels‚Äö√Ñ√¥ legal authority to impose the new tax.

‚Äö√Ñ√∫Our challenge is targeted only at the counter-productive windfall profits tax, and not any other elements of the package to reduce energy prices,‚Äö√Ñ√π ExxonMobil said in a statement.

 The company said it had invested $3bn in the past decade in refinery projects in Europe, helping to reduce European reliance on imports from Russia.

The launching of a legal case by a US oil supermajor against the EU comes as fossil fuel giants come under mounting pressure on both sides of the Atlantic over the vast profits being reported by energy companies this year.

Earlier this summer Joe Biden hit out, saying ExxonMobil ‚Äö√Ñ√∫made more money than God this year‚Äö√Ñ√π, and has since accused oil companies of ‚Äö√Ñ√∫war profiteering‚Äö√Ñ√π and raised the possibility of imposing a windfall tax if they don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t boost domestic production. 

The firm said it recognised that the energy crisis was ‚Äö√Ñ√∫weighing heavily on families and businesses‚Äö√Ñ√π, and that it was working to increase energy supplies to Europe as the continent pushes to reduce its consumption of Russian energy. 

Several European governments have introduced local windfall taxes on energy company profits, including in Germany, Spain and Italy.",US oil producer contests legal authority for ‚Äö√Ñ√≤solidarity contribution‚Äö√Ñ√¥ aimed at raising funds to offset soaring energy prices,XOM,2023-01-09,positive,0.75424707,0.22215128,0.023601595,2023-01-09,111.63999938964844,111.63999938964844,107.80999755859375,108.47000122070312,103.92305755615234,17964600,XOM

In a complaint filed on Tuesday with a federal court in Washington, D.C., Juul accused the FDA of invoking the ""widely abused"" deliberative process privilege to improperly withhold scientific materials that are ""central"" to understanding the basis for the June 23 sales ban. 

Juul said the materials would show whether the FDA conducted a legally required balancing of the public health benefits and risks of its products, including claims they help smokers quit cigarettes, and whether the agency's reasoning was scientifically sound.

""The public deserves a complete picture of the scientific facts behind one of the agency's most controversial and closely scrutinized decisions in recent years,"" Juul said.

An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment, saying the agency does not discuss pending litigation.

Juul accused the FDA of violating the federal Freedom of Information Act by withholding a majority of the ""scientific disciplinary reviews"" underlying the sales ban.

The historic increase in mortgage rates this year, sparked by the Federal Reserve‚Äö√Ñ√¥s aggressive campaign to tame inflation, has pulled back housing demand and crushed builder confidence.

The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage sits near 7%, according to Freddie Mac. 

‚Äö√Ñ√∫The rapid rise in mortgage rates, coupled with high inflation and general economic uncertainty, have made many buyers pause in their home-buying decision or choose to not move forward with their home purchase,‚Äö√Ñ√π President and CEO David Auld said in a conference call to discuss earnings.

Horton, which is ‚Äö√Ñ√∫offering mortgage interest rate locks and buy-downs and other sales incentives to address affordability concerns and to drive sales traffic to our communities,‚Äö√Ñ√π Bill W. Wheat, executive vice president and CFO, said. 

Wall Street analysts say it will come down to ‚Äö√Ñ√∫stabilization‚Äö√Ñ√π in rates for home builders; otherwise it will be a long road ahead.

‚Äö√Ñ√∫What it's going to come down to is we need a stabilization [of] rates ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ full stop ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ that's what we need,‚Äö√Ñ√π John Lovallo, an UBS analyst, told Yahoo Finance.",Buyers canceled nearly a third of deals in D.R.

Caesars Palace is plotting a bid to open a huge casino in New York's Times Square - sparking fears the tourist hot spot could return to its notoriously-seedy past.

SL Green Realty Corporation and Caesars Entertainment are forming a pro-casino coalition in the hopes of securing one of three new casino licenses for the Big Apple approved by Empire State officials earlier this year.

Their proposal would open a Caesars Palace at 1515 Broadway, in a skyscraper that sits above the theater that houses The Lion King musical. 

SL Green CEO Marc Holliday told the Times that the casino would be fully equipped to avoid the mistakes of the past. 

'The proposal from the developer for a Times Square casino would be a game changer that boosts security and safety in the Times Square neighborhood with increased security staff, more sanitation equipment and new cameras,' the association said in a statement. 

'We applaud the developer's commitment to make the neighborhood safer for arts workers and audience members alike.'

"When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. Schlumberger is expected to post earnings of $0.69 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +68.3%. 

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.","Schlumberger (SLB) has been one of the stocks most watched by Zacks users lately.

WASHINGTON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate committee will hold a hearing on Jan. 24 on the lack of competition in the ticketing industry after Ticketmaster's problems managing the sale of Taylor Swift concert tickets. 

""The issues within America‚Äö√Ñ√¥s ticketing industry were made painfully obvious when Ticketmaster‚Äö√Ñ√¥s website failed hundreds of thousands of fans hoping to purchase tickets for Taylor Swift‚Äö√Ñ√¥s new tour, but these problems are not new,"" said Senator Amy Klobuchar, who heads an antitrust subcommittee. 

Ticketmaster, which antitrust experts contend commands more than 70% market share of primary ticket services for major U.S. concert venues, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment late Tuesday. In November, the company denied any anti-competitive practices and noted it remained under a consent decree with the Justice Department following its 2010 merger with Live Nation, adding that there was no ""evidence of systemic violations of the consent decree.""

Consent decrees are often used to prohibit potentially anticompetitive practices or impose other requirements as a condition of merger approvals.

A previous Ticketmaster dispute with the Justice Department culminated in a December 2019 settlement extending the consent agreement into 2025.

"Hilton reported a disappointing first-quarter earnings for hotel operators, with its shares dropping nearly 5%. The travel industry had largely avoided the effects of higher interest rates on consumer spending, but was set for a full recovery after major market China reopened from COVID curbs. Despite this, executives remained confident about the momentum in demand continuing in the near-term, including in international travel, led by U.S. travelers and China's reopening. The company now expects full-year adjusted profit per share between $5.68 and $ 5.88.

OMAHA, Neb. (AP) ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ Here‚Äö√Ñ√¥s what‚Äö√Ñ√¥s in the tentative agreement that railroad unions secured to prevent a potential freight railroad strike. 

The final deal was negotiated by the unions that represent engineers and conductors, but all 12 of the rail unions will likely benefit from the concessions railroads made because the unions that agreed to deals earlier all had provisions in their deals that will allow them to do that. 

Railroad workers will receive 24% raises and $5,000 in bonuses in the deal that is retroactive to 2020. 

The recommendations from the Presidential Emergency Board provided significant raises, but didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t address union concerns about working conditions.","OMAHA, Neb.

"Norfolk Southern is facing yet another probe into its handling of a separate incident that occurred just weeks after the toxic train derailment in East Palestine. The train reportedly encountered a malfunction where one of its cars was 'trending hot', but not hot enough to trigger an actual alarm. The crew supported this assessment, but ultimately decided to overrule the crew and continue forward. The Federal Railroad Administration is now investigating the incident as part of a broader'safety assessment' the embattled transport company, which has seen two derailments in the span of a month, and a Tuesday crash that left a conductor dead. This week, Norfolk CEO Alan Shaw will be grilled by senators over a series of derailments, where he is expected to apologize.

Norfolk Southern, the train company that owns the train in the derailment, pulled out of the meeting at the last moment due to perceived threats to their workers' safety. The company noted that it was ""not going anywhere"" and that it would continue to work with locals to solve the problem. Governor Mike DeWine (R-OH) demanded that the company be held accountable and do more to help clean up the mess.

"This article by Simply Wall St.com and Aflac (NYSE:AFL) presents an analysis of how investors should expect an opportunity to invest in profitable, growing companies such as AflAC (NYSE):AFL). It also discusses the company's earnings per share growth and insider ownership, as well as how its revenue and earnings before interest and tax margins are changing. The analysis also looks at how the company has managed to grow EPS by 22% per year over three years and its EBIT margins are flat and its revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months. Finally, it also looks to see that insiders are owning a large percentage of a US$42b company like Aflacs, and this suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Aflaca's continuing strength.

"The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) on Friday has led to a public debate about the role and responsibility of former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden in the failing of several banks during their time in office. Donald Trump Jr. and other conservatives are blaming Biden for the collapse of the California-headquartered SVB, but it is being pointed out that many more banks failed under Trump. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) reports that eight banks failed in 2017, four in 2019 and four in 2020. The number of bank failures has dropped to relatively normal levels after spiking in the years of the financial crisis. The bank's collapse has been widely attributed to a series of ill-fated investments, but fears of contagion to the general banking sector have been staved off by the Biden administration.

"PA Consulting, a global research group, has found that a lack of understanding between clinicians, medtech and pharma is slowing progress in shifting the hospital to home care. The report found that nearly two thirds of healthcare leaders across public and private healthcare believe that moving care from hospital to hospital will help curtail rising healthcare costs in the next three years. Despite this, health and care professionals are wary of under-developed infrastructure, technological and financial implications, and clinical and reputational impact.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that institutions like the Fed must 'resist the temptation' to try and tackle social issues such as climate change in a speech in Sweden Tuesday. 

'Taking on new goals, however worthy,' such as climate or social policy, he said, 'without a clear statutory mandate would undermine the case for our independence.'

Notoriously, in 2022, President Joe Biden had Sarah Bloom Raskin, one of his nominees to the Fed's Board of Governors, withdrew after failing to gain enough support. 

Powell, now in his fifth year as Fed chair, has put a high priority on building strong relationships with elected officials from both major U.S. parties, but faced criticism from some Republicans for, in their view, allowing the Fed to wander from its core responsibilities into areas like climate change and the economics of race. 

When the Fed recently asked for public comment about 'a high-level framework for the safe and sound management of exposures to climate-related financial risks,' Fed Governor Christopher Waller said he did not support issuing guidance on the issue because while 'climate change is real... I disagree with the premise that it poses a serious risk' to financial stability.",Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that institutions like the Fed must 'resist the temptation' to try and tackle social issues such as climate change in a speech in Sweden.,BLK,2023-02-02,positive,0.7663251,0.21265431,0.021020496,2023-02-02,763.9000244140625,781.77001953125,763.1400146484375,770.72998046875,749.1310424804688,1101700,BLK

The Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma) found on Wednesday that reporter Sarah Ferguson‚Äö√Ñ√¥s two-part documentary Fox and the Big Lie breached the accuracy and fair dealing requirements of the ABC‚Äö√Ñ√¥s editorial code, but did not violate impartiality standards. 

Ferguson, who was based in the US bureau at the time of the documentary but is now the host of ABC current affairs program 7.30, said that understanding how one of the world‚Äö√Ñ√¥s most powerful media companies supported a damaging conspiracy that the election was stolen was ‚Äö√Ñ√∫a compelling story in the best traditions of public interest journalism‚Äö√Ñ√π.

‚Äö√Ñ√∫The overwhelming majority of issues raised by Fox were rejected by the regulator.

‚Äö√Ñ√∫However, ACMA‚Äö√Ñ√¥s final report and its inflammatory press release raise questions about the regulator‚Äö√Ñ√¥s understanding of journalism.‚Äö√Ñ√π

Ferguson said that among the ‚Äö√Ñ√∫simplest and silliest‚Äö√Ñ√π assertions made by the regulator were that using the word ‚Äö√Ñ√∫mob‚Äö√Ñ√π to describe the 6 January rioters was emotive and strident language, that it was wrong to stop a Fox presenter who was a ‚Äö√Ñ√∫cheerleader‚Äö√Ñ√π for the ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Big Lie‚Äö√Ñ√π on a public street and ask her questions, and that the ABC should have included a Fox press release that was almost three years old in its story.

‚Äö√Ñ√∫In its report, responding to extensive complaints by Fox, ACMA says 19 times the ABC did not breach impartiality or mislead the audience. 

Under the sub-heading ‚Äö√Ñ√∫huge implications for journalism‚Äö√Ñ√π, Ferguson said a finding by Acma that the ABC misled the audience by failing to cover the role of social media in relation to the 6 January insurrection ‚Äö√Ñ√∫most challenges the ABC‚Äö√Ñ√¥s freedom to pursue public interest journalism fearlessly‚Äö√Ñ√π.

It would be a major change for the reserve, as current law permits non-U.S.-based operators to bid on SPR crude oil or to otherwise purchase it from traders who have acquired it ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ something that has been occurring with oil released under Biden's direction to the irritation of some lawmakers who oppose the prospect of product going abroad while prices remain high domestically. 

Reuters reported in July that cargoes of SPR crude oil were headed to China, India, Italy, and the Netherlands. 

It's not clear, however, how successfully either bill would address the instances of SPR oil being bought by a U.S. company and then sold to a foreign operator, as what happened over the summer.

At least as things stand under the law, the Energy Department explained in July, U.S. companies ""are permitted to place bids on SPR crude oil; DOE cannot dictate what selected bidders will do with the SPR crude oil after delivery.""

Some have argued it doesn't matter that SPR oil goes abroad because the oil market is global, arguing that meeting demand anywhere helps prices everywhere.

"A long-running sexual harassment and gender discrimination lawsuit against Nike has produced more than 5,000 pages of records, including surveys of female employees that allege sexist attitudes and behavior at the sportwear giant alongside corporate bullying and fears of retaliation. 

The documents, which date back to 2018, detail how female employees at the company were concerned that Nike‚Äö√Ñ√¥s management were unlikely to address their concerns. 

In one survey, obtained by the Business Insider, an employee wrote that she had been directed by male co-workers to ‚Äö√Ñ√∫dress sexier‚Äö√Ñ√π; another identified certain executives as ‚Äö√Ñ√∫well known philanderers with lower level employees whom they exert influence and power over‚Äö√Ñ√π.

The so-called Starfish surveys were delivered to chief executive Mark Parker ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ who has since become Nike‚Äö√Ñ√¥s executive chairperson ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ in March 2018, prompting news reports and company efforts to reform Nike‚Äö√Ñ√¥s alleged ‚Äö√Ñ√∫boys‚Äö√Ñ√¥ club‚Äö√Ñ√π culture.

But the surveys themselves remained out of sight until they were unsealed after a legal challenge by Insider, the Oregonian, and the Portland Business Journal for a protective order to be lifted on a lawsuit that seeks to expand the number of plaintiffs from 14 to a class-action case involving roughly 5,000.

Since the inaugural issue of The Prudent Speculator was published in March 1977, the Small-Cap Value subset of stocks (as determined by portfolios constructed by Professors Eugene F.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday heard arguments over whether states can require corporations to consent to the jurisdiction of their courts when they register to do business in the state, in a case that could dramatically expand state courts' jurisdiction over corporations around the country.

The dispute arises from a petition by Virginia resident Robert Mallory, who asked the nation's top court to revive his lawsuit in Pennsylvania state court against his former employer, Virginia-based Norfolk Southern Railway Co, claiming he developed colon cancer because of asbestos exposure on the job. 

He said at the time the 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868, many states had consent-by-registration laws, and that the Supreme Court had upheld one in a never-overturned 1917 ruling, Pennsylvania Fire Insurance Co v. Gold Issue Mining Co. 

The U.S. Solicitor General, business groups and eight state attorneys general have all urged the court to rule against Mallory, saying that if Pennsylvania's law is revived, other states could pass similar laws, leading to forum-shopping and undermining state sovereignty.

The Justice Department has reportedly opened an antitrust investigation into Live Nation. Specific questions have centered around whether Live Nation has honored a consent decree the company made with the Justice Department upon its merger with Ticketmaster in 2010, in which Live Nation promised not to punish concert venues who used competing ticket platforms by withholding access to its promoted tours.

The Justice Department previously found evidence of Live Nation engaging in such behavior after launching an investigation in 2018. Under terms of the ensuing settlement, Live Nation agreed to extend the consent decree to 2025 and reimbursed the Justice Department for the costs of its investigation.

"A survey from global consulting firm Protiviti has found that technical debt, a term that generally refers to the cost of maintaining legacy technology, can hold organizations back from innovation. The survey found that nearly 70% of organizations report having defined innovation goals, but only 54% can outline an accompanying strategy for achieving it.

"

(Bloomberg) -- Democratic Senators are set to propose a bill that would force US oil companies to pay more tax at time when they‚Äö√Ñ√¥re raking in record profits in a sign that the war of words between the party and the energy industry will continue even after the midterm elections.
‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ None 

Seven senators led by Bob Menendez of New Jersey are proposing to remove key tax provisions enjoyed by oil producers such as drilling cost deductions, deep water royalty relief and carbon capture credits for enhanced oil recovery, according to a draft of the bill seen by Bloomberg. The Department of the Interior made recommendations for some changes to leasing provisions as part of its Biden-ordered review earlier this year.

The bills signal that some Democrats, emboldened by their success at the midterm elections, are unlikely to ignore public pressure on oil producers over the past few months, during which President Joe Biden frequently attacked executives for not investing enough in new production and enjoying a ‚Äö√Ñ√∫windfall from war.‚Äö√Ñ√π

‚Äö√Ñ√∫The American people shouldn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t have to subsidize Big Oil CEOs and shareholders while families are hit with high prices at the pump,‚Äö√Ñ√π Menendez said. The bill ‚Äö√Ñ√∫is intended to disincentivize oil companies from holding onto non-producing leases in order to inflate the reserves that they boast to shareholders, while limiting supply and gouging consumers at the pump,‚Äö√Ñ√π the statement from the senator‚Äö√Ñ√¥s office said.

‚Äö√Ñ√∫The oil industry is utilizing less than half of the federal land that they already have, all while declining to increase production and raking in record profits.‚Äö√Ñ√π

"Pioneers 3M and DuPont, as well as more than a dozen other companies, are accused of conspiring to hide the dangers of chemicals also known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances or PFAS. Used in consumer products such as clothing, food packaging and cookware, the chemicals build up in human blood, take years to leave the body and are linked to health problems including cancer.

Illinois joins several other states, including California, Minnesota, North Carolina and New York, that previously filed lawsuits against PFAS manufacturers. Once-secret 3M documents unearthed during previous lawsuits show top executives knew about the harmful effects of PFAS as early as the 1950s, when the company began mass-producing perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) to make Scotchgard, a widely used stain repellent, and selling perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) to DuPont to manufacture Teflon coatings for cookware, clothing and wiring.

Ambiguity about and interest in ESG metrics

Interest in ESG dates back to earlier discussions around corporate social responsibility (CSR) years ago. Atmos helps firms overcome this barrier by creating a platform with customized ESG reporting questions that are based on the firm‚Äö√Ñ√¥s industry, sector, and size, transforming their answers into generated reports, such as their Materiality Assessment & ESG Metrics scorecards. Furthermore, a lack of strategy for thoughtfully managing ESG considerations can cause proposed deals to face obstacles‚Äö√Ñ√Æor cancellation,‚Äö√Ñ√π according to a 2022 study by Bain.

Oct 26 (Reuters) - Futures exchange operator CME Group Inc (CME.O) reported third-quarter profits that beat expectations as volatility in the global markets amid high inflation, aggressive rate hikes and recession fears, drove trading volumes higher. 

Stripping out one-time items, such as M&A costs, CME earned $1.98 per share in the three-months ending Sept. 30, compared with the consensus expectation of analysts of $1.94, according to Refinitiv IBES data. 

The earnings beat came from a combination of modestly higher-than-expected revenues and lower-than-anticipated expenses, said Jefferies analyst Daniel Fannon. 

CME's volumes are up 23% year-to-date over a year earlier, Chief Executive Officer Terry Duffy said on a call with analysts.","Futures exchange operator CME Group Inc reported third-quarter profits that beat expectations as volatility in the global markets amid high inflation, aggressive rate hikes and recession fears, drove trading volumes higher.",CME,2023-02-14,positive,0.7343166,0.24212566,0.023557676,2023-02-14,186.07000732421875,187.44000244140625,184.92999267578125,186.38999938964844,177.75819396972656,1225500,CME

With considerable fanfare this past February, the White House it was ‚Äö√Ñ√∫reigniting‚Äö√Ñ√π one of then-Vice President Joe Biden ‚Äö√Ñ√¥s signature issues: the so-called cancer moonshot, which is supposed to ‚Äö√Ñ√∫end cancer as we know it.‚Äö√Ñ√π

Six short months later, the president signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a law that will discourage cancer research more than any other federal law ever enacted.

The IRA allows the federal government to set prices for the 60 top-selling drugs in the Medicare program for the first time. 

Less discussed, however, are the fine print provisions of the IRA that are particularly harmful to cancer research. One provision, for example, allows the federal government to set prices on small molecule drugs only 9 years after they are launched, compared to large molecules (sometimes called ‚Äö√Ñ√∫biologics‚Äö√Ñ√π), which will get 13 years of immunity from price controls.

While there are some biologics that work well against cancer, small molecule drugs have certain advantages in treating cancer. Lilly‚Äö√Ñ√¥s read, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫The IRA changes many dynamics for small molecules in oncology and when we integrated those changes with this program and its competitive landscape, the program‚Äö√Ñ√¥s future investment no longer met our threshold.‚Äö√Ñ√π

It is also possible that, since price controls will apply in the Medicare program that covers older Americans, cancer R&D will shift to childhood cancers where new therapies will not be subject to Medicare‚Äö√Ñ√¥s price controls, and research on cancers that typically impact older Americans will likely move to the back of the R&D line. 

This is a particularly harmful provision for cancer research, as many cancer drugs work effectively on more than one type of cancer, and many cancer drugs become commercially viable when they secure multiple indications.","With considerable fanfare this past February, the White House announced it was ‚Äö√Ñ√∫reigniting‚Äö√Ñ√π one of then-Vice President Joe Biden‚Äö√Ñ√¥s signature issues: the so-called cancer moonshot, which is supposed to ‚Äö√Ñ√∫end cancer as we know it.‚Äö√Ñ√π",LLY,2023-02-14,positive,0.75923866,0.21759018,0.023171097,2023-02-14,350.5400085449219,353.82000732421875,347.2799987792969,347.55999755859375,344.6746520996094,2028900,LLY

One of the commercial real estate maxims of the last year holds smart employers are now or soon will be trading in more office space for less but higher-quality office space. 

A mid-August CBRE report titled ‚Äö√Ñ√∫The Flight to Quality Quantified‚Äö√Ñ√π reported that as office space gets reimagined and remote work patterns solidify, tenants have quickened their transitions to prime office properties. 

This week, with its Q3 U.S. Office Market Report, JLL confirmed the same forces apply now, as employers escalate their pressure on workers to return to offices.

‚Äö√Ñ√∫Flight to quality continues to be the driving force behind most companies‚Äö√Ñ√¥ leasing decisions, which has driven down renewal rates in favor of relocations to higher-end space,‚Äö√Ñ√π JLL said in a prepared statement. ‚Äö√Ñ√∫And despite inflationary pressures having only moderately alleviated, the flight to quality higher-end space is expected to propel a robust high-end segment of the office market.‚Äö√Ñ√π

The flight to quality is being driven by office tenants desiring growth space for their companies and organizations. 

Nearness to public transit has essentially evaporated from employers‚Äö√Ñ√¥ wish lists when it comes to their searches for available office space.","As employers strive to convince their workers to return to the office, a flight to quality is driving many to move from more to less but higher-quality, amenity-rich office space.",CBRE,2023-02-15,positive,0.7606021,0.21926472,0.020133095,2023-02-15,87.87000274658203,89.56999969482422,87.87000274658203,89.51000213623047,89.51000213623047,993100,CBRE

Inflation is taking a bite out of Olive Garden owner Darden Restaurants, which said its profits are getting chewed up by the rising cost of food and labor. 

The Orlando-based company ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ which also owns chains including LongHorn Steakhouse and Capitol Grill ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ has been reluctant to raise prices, particularly at Olive Garden, even as workers demand higher wages and raw food costs surge.

While consumers are eating out as much as they did before the pandemic ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ and in some cases more ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ the restaurant industry is struggling with how to pass along or absorb higher costs.

Darden said in June it has kept price increases at below inflation, but also has quietly axed popular promotions like free pasta refills at Olive Garden. 

Olive Garden still offers its ‚Äö√Ñ√∫never-ending first course‚Äö√Ñ√π ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ soup, salad and breadsticks ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ but the chain started to cut discounting during the pandemic, executives said on an earnings call in June. 

‚Äö√Ñ√∫I am pleased with the performance of all our brands in what remains a challenging inflationary and uncertain macroeconomic environment,‚Äö√Ñ√π Darden chief executive Rick Cardenas said in a statement.

‚Äö√Ñ√∫We had a solid quarter,‚Äö√Ñ√π he added, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫and we saw more normal seasonality return to our business, which we did not experience last year.‚Äö√Ñ√π

Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. 

Investors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others.","Dividends are one of the best benefits to being a shareholder, but finding a great dividend stock is no easy task.

"A new report by Ethical Consumer magazine has found that the three main toilet brands in the UK have cut the amount of recycled paper in their tissues, and that the use of virgin wood pulp is fuelling deforestation. Kimberly-Clark, which makes Andrex, and Essity, both made the report recommend avoiding buying products because more material used to make them is taken from felled trees. The report also found that European forests had grown from 2005 to 2015 and 74% of all paper used in Europe was recycled. All three companies named in the report take virgin wood from certified schemes like the Forestry Stewardship Council (FSC). However, Two Sides, a membership organisation for forestry, pulp and other paper manufacturers, said paper production contributed to deforestation since ‚Äö√Ñ√∫all trees used for making paper products are replanted‚Äö√Ñ√π and that recycling is more efficient than cutting down trees as it produces less wastewater and other waste and requires less energy.

A release from the Tent Partnership for Refugees, a nonprofit that advocates for the international business community to embrace refugees, on Tuesday said 45 major companies have committed to hire 22,725 refugees to full-time positions in the U.S.

Tent Partnership organized the U.S. Business Summit on Refugees to bring together some of the country‚Äö√Ñ√¥s largest employers to create and plan to hire and train the refugees over the next three years. The release states that the companies‚Äö√Ñ√¥ commitments to support refugees are the most significant on record. 

Other major companies promising to hire refugees include Tyson Foods, which will hire 2,500, and Pfizer, which will hire 500.

‚Äö√Ñ√∫These companies will benefit from welcoming these hard-working, loyal, and resilient individuals ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ but my hope is that this is only the beginning,‚Äö√Ñ√π said Hamdi Ulukaya, the founder of Tent. ‚Äö√Ñ√∫As refugee crises start to fade from the headlines, companies must recognize that hiring refugees is not only the right thing to do, but also the smart thing to do.‚Äö√Ñ√π

 

The hiring commitments should generate more than $900 million overall in income for the refugees each year while filling ‚Äö√Ñ√∫key‚Äö√Ñ√π labor gaps and boosting the national economy, it added.

Companies like LinkedIn and Ipsos have also promised to train 13,850 refugees to give them a better understanding of the U.S. job market and help them develop skills and grow their networks,","Amazon, hotel chains among firms vowing to hire 20,000 refugees",AMZN,2023-02-17,positive,0.7605624,0.2152067,0.024230925,2023-02-17,97.80000305175781,97.94000244140625,95.6500015258789,97.19999694824219,97.19999694824219,60029400,AMZN

The firm ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ one of the world‚Äö√Ñ√¥s biggest plastic polluters, using around 3 million tonnes of plastic packaging a year ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ has been accused of ""greenwashing"", and a petition has been launched calling for their removal as a sponsor to the event.

Almost 13,000 people have signed the petition, which accuses the company of spending ""millions of dollars greenwashing their brand, making us believe that they are solving the problem"".

Georgia Elliot-Smith, an engineer who started the petition, said: ""COP conferences are supposed to be gatherings of national leaders, engaged in urgent negotiations to prevent climate change, not a multi-million dollar jamboree for corporate polluters and their lobbyists."" When you centre a company that has actively avoided engaging with trade unions, its human rights record, let alone the devastating environmental impact of its business model, you actively exclude other important voices. In August, campaign group Surfers Against Sewage named Coca-Cola the number one polluter among the ""dirty dozen"" brands whose waste litters UK shores.

The CHIPS and Science Act, signed into law in August, provides chipmakers with $78 billion in grants and tax breaks to manufacture semiconductors in the U.S. in an effort to lessen the nation‚Äö√Ñ√¥s dependence on foreign-made microchips.

Intel Corp. spent $2 million to deploy lobbyists to Capitol Hill, the Pentagon, Commerce Department and President Biden‚Äö√Ñ√¥s office in the third quarter of 2022, according to a report filed with Congress. The company contracted with lobbyists who previously served as top aides to Biden and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).

The leading chipmakers warned lawmakers that they would cancel planned manufacturing facilities in the U.S. if Congress didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t pass the bill before the August recess. Micron recently announced plans to invest up to $100 billion over the next two decades to build a semiconductor factory in upstate New York.

Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said that the investment would strengthen ‚Äö√Ñ√∫U.S. technology leadership as well as economic and national security, driving American innovation and competitiveness for decades to come.‚Äö√Ñ√π

 Semiconductor companies in recent decades outsourced microchip production to Taiwan, South Korea and China, prompting concerns that the U.S. could eventually lose access to chips that are used in everything from appliances to military weapons.","Intel Corp. and Micron Technology hiked their lobbying spending to record levels as they pushed Congress to approve billions of dollars in new subsidies.

Credit Market Cracks Start To Appear As Three Companies Sideline Investment Grade Bond Sales

 The US high-grade CDX, a key measure of perceived credit risk, just recently hit a new year-to-date high.



However, signs of stress are emerging on the Fed's investment grade corporate bond market distress indicator (CMDI).

"Wednesday's Republican presidential debate was a chance to project a new image to the American people.

Fox reverted to ""respect"" in an audience-gratifying way, tilting and stilting debate set-up questions in a manner that made the network's partisanship part of the narrative.

There's been bipartisan interest in creating a state landslide insurance program for homeowners, but so far the city has been shelling out a few million dollars per year for remediation and monitoring.

"Norway gives go-ahead for Oseberg gas field expansion. The Norwegian energy ministry on Thursday said it had approved operator Equinor's (EQNR.OL) plan for new investments in the North Sea Oseberg petroleum fields, which will boost gas exports to Europe.

Michigan International Speedway and concert promoter Live Nation Worldwide Inc. each are pointing fingers and deflecting blame in response to a lawsuit alleging their negligence contributed to the carbon monoxide deaths of three men camping at the 2021 Faster Horses Festival.

Live Nation, which stages the massive three-day country music event in southern Michigan, contends MIS, by agreement, is responsible for the development of a ‚Äö√Ñ√∫camping plan‚Äö√Ñ√π with various levels and amenities and campground rules.

MIS, which owns the racetrack and sprawling grounds near Brooklyn, says the festival agreement states the stadium, all equipment and the campgrounds are provided to Live Nation ‚Äö√Ñ√∫as is.‚Äö√Ñ√π MIS makes no representation or warranty to the fitness of the stadium or the campgrounds for the event or any particular purpose.‚Äö√Ñ√π

‚Äö√Ñ√∫Accordingly, the festival agreement makes it clear that Live Nation was responsible for campsite monitoring and supervision.‚Äö√Ñ√π

Families of high school football teammates and friends Dawson Brown and William Richie Mays Jr., both 20, and Kole Sova, 19, sued MIS and Live Nation in April after the three died July 17, 2021 at Junction Campground, off Brooklyn Highway near U.S. 12.

While sleeping in a camper, they inhaled or were exposed to exhaust fumes from a portable generator secured to the tongue area and exhausting under the trailer, the Lenawee County Sheriff‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Office reported. Attempts to speak with Richard Joslin, lawyer for Live Nation, and Ron Marienfeld, who is representing the families, Johnson and Stitt, were not successful.

Johnson, Stitt and the relatives of Brown, Mays and Sova contend Live Nation and MIS were negligent, requiring recreational vehicles to use campsites in ‚Äö√Ñ√∫very close proximity‚Äö√Ñ√π and against Michigan campground regulations.

Michigan‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Public Health Code requires ‚Äö√Ñ√∫the service building, grounds, and facilities shall be maintained in a clean and sanitary condition and kept in good order.‚Äö√Ñ√π 

It cites an agreement between Live Nation and MIS that stipulates MIS will hold Live Nation harmless against claims resulting from any ‚Äö√Ñ√∫act of omission of MIS or its employees, agents or contractors in connection with MIS‚Äö√Ñ√¥ performance of its obligations under this agreement.‚Äö√Ñ√π

The Speedway says Live Nation, again by agreement, is responsible for contracting with all third-party vendors or service providers and providing ‚Äö√Ñ√∫interface with guest and customer services in connection with the event.‚Äö√Ñ√π

Faster Horses this year boasted of enlarged campsites at Junction and two other campgrounds, its website showed. Sova, a three-sport athlete, graduated at the top of his class and worked at the Jiffy mix plant in Chelsea while taking college classes.

They all graduated from Michigan Center High School near Jackson and the tragedy inspired many local and lasting tributes, honors and memorials.

"Indigenous artisans took part in a series of fashion shows in Mexico recently to show off their designs and raise awareness of what they've denounced as plagiarism and cultural appropriation by major designer brands. 

Why it matters: Millions of Indigenous peoples try to make a living and maintain their heritage by selling crafts and weaving designs but rarely see the profits, according to a recent report from the UN's Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues.
‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ That's partly because there isn't a global patent standard for such works, and intellectual property laws in some countries can be confusing, lawyers say.
‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ So Indigenous folk artists sometimes accept haggled prices for fear of not selling ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ with losses up to 30%, studies show ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ or their designs are simply stolen, with the artists receiving no credit or compensation.

Details: The Original fashion week in Mexico last month included Indigenous designers from Latin America and Africa, fair price sale stalls, conferences and catwalks.
‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ It was partly organized by Mexico's Culture Ministry, which also runs campaigns to prevent unauthorized profiteering from historical Mesoamerican artifacts.

This spring, there was more work than many companies could handle, but a shortage of labor and materials. 

The situation is especially perplexing for companies that were in business during the 2008 housing crash, which sent skilled workers fleeing to other industries. 

That recession happened when Ryan wasn't yet in charge and about 90% of the company's customers were home builders. Last week, the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index showed that home prices in the Twin Cities during September were more than 6% higher than last year at the same time.","'It's like trying to turn the Titanic,' the second-generation owner says.",PHM,2023-03-08,positive,0.7943357,0.18535624,0.020308005,2023-03-08,54.41999816894531,54.790000915527344,53.7599983215332,54.75,54.25835037231445,2886800,PHM

Why it matters: Much like the web and mobile revolutions did in preceding eras, AI is on track to spawn new business models and processes, tightening up the relationship between people and technology.

SEATTLE (AP) ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ The first payments from a $518 million settlement with the nation's three largest opioid distributors will begin reaching Washington communities in December, providing much-needed cash officials can use to hire first responders or direct toward prevention, treatment and other services, Attorney General Bob Ferguson said Monday. 

Over the last two decades, the deaths of more than 500,000 Americans have been linked to overdoses of opioids, including both prescription pain kills and illicit drugs such as heroin. 

The attorney general argued that the three companies shipped such a vast amount of drugs to Washington that it was obvious they were fueling addiction: Opioid sales in the state rose more than 500% between 1997 and 2011.

In an online discussion last week on RetailWire, BrainTrust members like Gary Sankary, retail industry strategy at Esri, found reason to believe McDonald‚Äö√Ñ√¥s move could be a good one.

‚Äö√Ñ√∫Are they trying to drive efficiency by fire ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ reduce headcount, increase the workload on the remaining staff ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ and hope they develop better processes?‚Äö√Ñ√π wrote Mr. Sankary. In July of 2021 McDonald‚Äö√Ñ√¥s made similar statements to the recent ones, in conjunction with the introduction of company veteran Manu Steijart to the role of chief customer officer. 

But for some BrainTrust members, a plan for more locations, automated or otherwise, raised questions.

"Israel is in a cooling off period after weeks of intense protests by vast segments of the population over a plan that would greatly weaken the country's Supreme Court. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he will delay legislation that critics say would weaken the judiciary, but business leaders are concerned about the impact of the political turmoil. The uncertainty in Israel's business sector extends deep into the business sector, with large Israeli businesses getting most of their revenue from the United States, Europe and Asia. Recent polls show two-thirds of Israelis are against the plan to change the judicial system, and some businesses worry that questions around taxation, worker rights, investor rights and other big issues could be decided by a supreme court that's appointed by a right-wing government whose beliefs they don't share.

"Louisiana Gov. Edwards defends carbon capture projects. 

About 50 Louisiana residents traveled to Baton Rouge on Tuesday to speak in opposition to a global gas supply company‚Äö√Ñ√¥s application for a test well permit in Lake Maurepas, where they plan to store carbon dioxide underground, The Advocate reported.

Most speakers at the hearing demanded that the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources pause approval of Air Products' project until the company releases an environmental impact statement detailing exactly how it would affect the lake and surrounding area.

But as residents, lawmakers and activists debated the project, Edwards voiced his support of carbon capture.

‚Äö√Ñ√∫As I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve said many times, I believe in the safety and the science that underlies carbon capture and sequestration. 

These types of projects, which capture airborne carbon emissions created during industrial production and store them deep underground, are gaining traction since Congress approved $3.5 billion for them last year.

In a November 2021 report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world‚Äö√Ñ√¥s top scientists said carbon capture and storage technology has to be part of the range of solutions to decarbonize and mitigate climate change.

They argued in a jointly signed court filing in March that ""despite access to expansive discovery, plaintiffs do not allege any direct evidence"" of a price-fixing conspiracy.

"Southwest Had ‚Äö√Ñ√≤Epic Screw Up‚Äö√Ñ√¥: Airline Faces Bipartisan Criticism In Congress. Southwest Airlines officials on Thursday testified before the Senate after its scheduling meltdown in December left millions of passengers stranded in airports nationwide, with the company‚Äö√Ñ√¥s COO conceding, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫we messed up.‚Äö√Ñ√π

Andrew Watterson, the COO of Southwest, told the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee the airline has since rebooked passengers‚Äö√Ñ√¥ flights at no extra cost, offered them rental cars and meals, processed refunds for unused flights and prioritized returning bags to proper owners, admitting, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫we messed up.‚Äö√Ñ√π Paul Hudson, president of the air travel advocacy group Flyers Rights, argued the airline‚Äö√Ñ√¥s use of ‚Äö√Ñ√∫unrealistic and deceptive scheduling‚Äö√Ñ√π is unacceptable, and suggested implementing delay compensation for passengers as well as a policy for airlines to match empty seats for passengers whose flights are delayed or canceled on other flights for no extra charge. That‚Äö√Ñ√¥s how many passengers were affected by Southwest Airlines‚Äö√Ñ√¥ scheduling meltdown in December, when more than 16,700 flights were canceled.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who lauded Southwest‚Äö√Ñ√¥s customer service operations nationwide for decades, argued the airline‚Äö√Ñ√¥s scheduling meltdown caused ‚Äö√Ñ√∫tens of thousands of Americans‚Äö√Ñ√π to ‚Äö√Ñ√∫miss Christmases at home, due initially to an unavoidable weather event but prolong for days because of the very serious failures at Southwest Airlines,‚Äö√Ñ√π calling it an ‚Äö√Ñ√∫epic screw up.‚Äö√Ñ√π

What To Watch For

Watterson told Senate members the company is in the midst of a ‚Äö√Ñ√∫top-to-bottom‚Äö√Ñ√π assessment of its technology and systems that led to the scheduling meltdown in December, adding the airline is committed to large-scale investments to improve its systems.","More than 16,000 Southwest Airlines flights were canceled in December amid a scheduling meltdown that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s come under fire.",LUV,2023-03-10,positive,0.72906184,0.24684934,0.02408883,2023-03-10,32.849998474121094,33.029998779296875,32.02000045776367,32.77000045776367,32.21340560913086,13423400,LUV

"Wells Fargo has downgraded both Valero Energy and Marathon Petroleum to equal weight from overweight, citing the falling prices for diesel and jet cracks. Analyst Roger Read slashed Valero's price target by $25 to $135, which now reflects an upside of 5.2% from Monday's close. He cut Marathon's by $18 to $ 135, implying the stock could advance 4.4% over the next year. The price changes imply the refinery sector will need to shift into ""maximum gasoline mode"" if it hasn't already, and this is not ideal because a focus on gasoline means a shift away from a three-pillared business model to one with two pillars is inherently less stable.

The proposed $24.6bn merger of Kroger and Albertsons could have dramatic consequences for customers, including higher prices for groceries and more food deserts, experts say. Christine Bartholomew, a law professor at the University of Buffalo who previously practiced antitrust and consumer-protection law, said that price hikes have followed grocery store mergers before, and that the same pattern is likely after any big grocery merger. 

The merger comes as food prices rise precipitously ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ 11.2% from September 2021 to September 2022, according to the US Department of Agriculture ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ and as several pandemic-aid programs end, sending more Americans to food banks to make ends meet.

Kroger‚Äö√Ñ√¥s chief executive, Rodney McMullen, told investors last week: ‚Äö√Ñ√∫We will take the learnings from each company to bring greater value and a better experience to more customers, more associates and more communities.‚Äö√Ñ√π A joint investigation in 2021 by the Guardian and Food & Water Watch found consumers already have few choices when they shop for groceries, with just a handful of companies controlling the majority market share of nearly 80% of everyday grocery items such as breakfast cereals, canned vegetables and rice.

Grocery workers are in demand in North Texas as H-E-B begins to open stores and other retailers need to fill in their ranks ahead of the holiday shopping season. 

Area stores aren‚Äö√Ñ√¥t as well staffed as they once were, and there can be long lines even at self-checkout lanes in many stores. Kroger said its store at Mockingbird Lane and Greenville Avenue in Dallas and several suburban stores in Flower Mound, Lantana and Southlake have a greater need for workers.

DETROIT (AP) ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ Shortages of computer chips and other parts continued to hobble the U.S. auto industry last year, contributing to vehicle sales dropping 8% from 2021 to their lowest level in more than a decade. 

But there's good news for consumers in the gloomy numbers: Vehicle supplies on dealer lots are growing, albeit slowly, and automakers expect at least a small easing in prices this year as inventories grow.

Automakers reported Wednesday that they sold 13.9 million cars, trucks, SUVs and vans last year as the parts shortage limited factory output amid high demand for new vehicles. 

For most of last year, people who wanted new vehicles had to pay sticker price or above and take whatever models and colors dealers could get. Kia sales fell 1.1% for the year, while Subaru was down 4.7%.

A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday ruled that U.S. employees who work overseas for companies based in the U.S. are not protected by a federal law prohibiting retaliation against workers who report securities violations. 

Garvey aimed to revive claims that he was forced to resign in 2016 after working with the company since 2006 when he reported alleged illegal activities that predominantly occurred outside the U.S.

He argued that the Sarbanes‚Äö√Ñ√¨Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX), which protects workers who report concerns about violations of securities laws, applies to securities fraud that occurs overseas but affects U.S. markets. 

However, the court of appeals argued that SOX‚Äö√Ñ√¥s whistleblower protections do not bar securities fraud, arguing that it instead ‚Äö√Ñ√∫protects employees from retaliation by making it unlawful for a company to ‚Äö√Ñ√≤discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or in any other manner discriminate against an employee in the terms and conditions of employment because of [the employee‚Äö√Ñ√¥s protected activity.]'‚Äö√Ñ√π

Two other Circuit courts in Boston and New York reached the same agreement.

Morgan Stanley denied retaliating against Garvey, who filed complaints with the U.S. Department of Labor. The former executive director of a legal and compliance division for Morgan Stanley subsidiaries, based in Japan and Hong Kong, claims that he was forced out of his job after he reported alleged corporate corruption and other illegal activities to his superiors.",A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday ruled that U.S. employees who work overseas for companies based in the U.S. are not protected by a federal law prohibiting retaliation against workers who report sec‚Äö√Ñ¬∂,MS,2023-03-16,negative,0.75074357,0.22887328,0.020383155,2023-03-16,84.55000305175781,88.27999877929688,83.27999877929688,87.01000213623047,83.62123107910156,15342400,MS
"First Solar, Inc. (FSLR) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately, and it is worth considering some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock. Over the past month, shares of this largest U.S. solar company have returned -7.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.3% change. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction? The Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. First Solar is expected to post earnings of $2.37 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +615.2%. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.21 indicates a change of $75.6% from what First Solar expected to report a year ago. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.53 billion and $4.72 billion estimates indicate +34.7% and +33.7%, respectively.","Recently, Zacks users have been paying close attention to First Solar (FSLR).

"Real Estate Matters looks at the growing demand for electric vehicles (EVs) in condo buildings as more residents buy electric vehicles. In 2018, there were just about 1 million EVs in the U.S. and the Department of Energy predicted that by 2025, there would be 20 million EVs by the end of the year.

Delta declined to comment, but referenced its most recent climate lobbying report, which states that Monroe is evaluating producing sustainable aviation fuel and other renewable fuels after conducting additional economic and operational analysis.

"If Congress doesn't mandate Boeing 737 MAX safety retrofits, Europe will.

 Even if Congress doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t force U.S. airlines to retrofit two new safety upgrades in their Boeing 737 MAX fleets, Europe‚Äö√Ñ√¥s aviation regulator intends to ensure those enhancements are mandated for carriers there.

 To get the MAX back in service in Europe, Boeing agreed with EASA to develop two major safety upgrades for the MAX 10 ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ the final and largest MAX variant ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ that within a few years afterwards would be retrofitted to the in-service fleet of MAX 8 and MAX 9 airplanes. 

Cantwell‚Äö√Ñ√¥s amendment would make it mandatory for U.S. airlines to add the upgrades to all the earlier MAX models now flying and to all MAXs they add to their fleets in future, with Boeing paying for the work.

Yet Michael Stumo, whose daughter Samya Rose Stumo died in the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and is a leading figure among families of the MAX crash victims, said that given EASA will mandate the upgrades he doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t see Cantwell‚Äö√Ñ√¥s compromise as adding much in terms of safety.

He said Cantwell‚Äö√Ñ√¥s amendment is ‚Äö√Ñ√∫weaker than it looks on face value because EASA will require it, and highly likely Canada will require it, and that will transmit those upgrades throughout a good part of the world.‚Äö√Ñ√π

Stumo wants Cantwell instead to leverage all her power as Commerce Committee chair to try to block any deadline extension and force Boeing to substantially enhance the MAX crew-alerting system.

With much political scrambling behind the scenes in Congress to get something done by yearend, the outcome remains unclear.

Cantwell‚Äö√Ñ√¥s move ties the question of whether the block to certifying the MAX 7 and 10 should be lifted to the separate issue of whether to mandate retrofits of the MAX 10 safety upgrades.","Even if Congress doesn't force U.S. airlines to retrofit two safety upgrades to their Boeing 737 MAX fleets, European regulators will do so for carriers in Europe",BA,2023-03-21,positive,0.736211,0.24246448,0.021324554,2023-03-21,207.3000030517578,207.86000061035156,203.88999938964844,204.6999969482422,204.6999969482422,4673300,BA

"BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is called to quit by pension chief over ESG obsession. 

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is accused of environment, social and governance (ESG) activism that is 'simply at odds with BlackRock's duty to investors'.

North Carolina State Treasurer Dale R. Folwell, financial chief of the state's $111.4 billion pension fund, called for Fink's resignation in a strongly-worded letter to BlackRock's directors sent on Friday.

Folwell notes that the North Carolina Retirement System has about $14 billion invested through the company.

He claims Fink is in 'pursuit of a political agenda' and adds: 'A focus on ESG is not a focus on returns and potentially could force us to violate our own fiduciary duty. 

'This not only concerns me as the State Treasurer but as Chair of the North Carolina State Banking Commission and the Local Government Commission.'

Earlier this week, it emerged that Texas state lawmakers subpoenaed BlackRock's records in a probe into its focus on ESG.

It follows mounting criticism of BlackRock from Republican lawmakers and state officials, who accuse the firm of putting social and political goals ahead of earning returns for investors and retirement savers. 

The ESG movement, and BlackRock's involvement, has recently become a rallying cry for Republicans on Capitol Hill, who are pushing for legislation to protect retirement and investment accounts from asset managers who prioritize ESG.","BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is accused of environment, social and governance (ESG) activism that is 'simply at odds with BlackRock's duty to investors'.",BLK,2023-03-22,positive,0.7771122,0.19960874,0.023279093,2023-03-22,660.0800170898438,667.4500122070312,647.8900146484375,648.3200073242188,634.7161865234375,480100,BLK

Proponents, including the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, say that the proposition would improve patient care, while dialysis clinic companies say the requirements are unnecessary and would place a larger financial burden on them that could lead to some clinics closing their doors.

"Russia forced to use its own accident-prone jet technology as sanctions hit airlines.

Russia is attempting to revive its accident-prone Cold War-era aviation industry after being pummelled by Western sanctions. Western sanctions means parts from these companies can no longer be supplied to Russia after its attack on Ukraine.

""Foreign aircraft will drop out of the fleet,"" Rostec told newswire Reuters. ""We believe that this process is irreversible and Boeing and Airbus planes will never be delivered to Russia.‚Äö√Ñ√π

Flag carrier Aeroflot and other Russian airlines have bought hundreds of Boeing and Airbus jets in recent decades in a bid to leave behind the rickety safety record of domestically made Soviet-era jets. 

Mr Cunningham said it would be quicker and easier to keep old jets flying by cannibalising parts from retired models, like Iran has since the 1979 Revolution to keep its own fleet flying without Western parts.

Rostec controls United Aircraft Corporation, the umbrella for Russian aircraft makers such as Ilyushin, Tupolev and Mikoyan.

Merchants including Dick‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Sporting Goods Inc., Lowe‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Cos. and Walmart Inc. say the rising stocks signal a recovery from last year‚Äö√Ñ√¥s shortages driven by supply-chain disruptions and put them in a strong position to take advantage of consumer demand this holiday shopping period.

‚Äö√Ñ√∫We‚Äö√Ñ√¥re really thrilled that we have in stock for Q4 inventory for the first time in a few years that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s going to be robust,‚Äö√Ñ√π Lauren Hobart, chief executive officer of Dick‚Äö√Ñ√¥s, said on an earnings call Nov. 22.

Supply-chain experts say the shifting views of some retailers toward the growing stockpiles are a sign of the rapid changes in consumer markets this year, as sellers of apparel, appliances and sports equipment try to take advantage of resilient demand in some sectors.

The companies building their inventories are looking to ensure they have items on hand at the right moment, said Vishal Gaur, professor of operations management at Cornell University‚Äö√Ñ√¥s SC Johnson College of Business.

‚Äö√Ñ√∫Oftentimes in retailing, customers face stockouts,‚Äö√Ñ√π Mr. Gaur said. 

TJX, which operates brands including T.J. Maxx, HomeGoods and Marshalls, said inventory was up 26% in the third quarter compared with last year. 

General merchandise stores‚Äö√Ñ√¥ level of inventories relative to sales has grown far beyond prepandemic levels as plans to restock stores and warehouses have ballooned out of sync with consumer buying patterns and left stockpiles of unsold goods. 

Jason Miller, an associate professor of logistics at Michigan State University‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Eli Broad College of Business, said merchants are wary of stockouts after shipping delays, factory closures and other bottlenecks last year led to long lead times for orders.

‚Äö√Ñ√∫If they can look and say, ‚Äö√Ñ√≤The stock we have on hand now really is going to allow us to provide our customers the service level we want to provide them, then yeah, it may be more than we had to have before Covid, but lead times are longer,‚Äö√Ñ√¥‚Äö√Ñ√π Mr. Miller said.

Most big firms attempting digital transformations today are frustrated with the results. At least a score of reasons help to explain the failure. But instead of an assumption that existing management practices should be retained, a necessary starting assumption is that every practice must be re-examined. 

The Foundational Assumption Of Management For The Last Half Century: MSV

The core problem for digital transformation is that it conflicts with the driving principle of big business for the last 50 years: the idea that the purpose of a firm is to maximize short-term shareholder value, and must be supported by generous stock compensation for executives to lock in that purpose (MSV).

The Washington Post‚Äö√Ñ√¥s recent investigation on how hundreds of former U.S. military officials have been working for repressive foreign governments like Saudi Arabia and the UAE is just the latest sign of how all too often U.S. foreign policy is determined by special interests rather than the national interest. 

But the employment of ex-admirals and generals by foreign governments seeking to shape U.S. foreign policy is just one component of a system that tips the balance in favor of an aggressive, militarized foreign policy. The influence of foreign governments and weapons contractors often work in lockstep, as in the push by companies like Raytheon and governments like Saudi Arabia and the UAE to promote weapons sales to the Gulf States.

"The President Of Live Nation Blamed Bot Attacks For Ticketmaster‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Meltdown Over Taylor Swift‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Ticket Sales.

In his opening remarks, Sen.

Joe Berchtold, president and chief financial officer of Live Nation Entertainment, used his testimony to begin by apologizing to Taylor Swift and her fans. ‚Äö√Ñ√∫In hindsight, there are several things we could have done better,‚Äö√Ñ√π Berchtold said. ""While the bots failed to penetrate our systems or acquire any tickets, the attack required us to slow down and even pause our sales; this is what led to a terrible customer experience."" ""In this forum where we are here to discuss public policy, we also need to recognize how industrial scalpers breaking the law using bots and cyberattacks to try to unfairly gain tickets contributes to an awful consumer experience,"" Berchtold added.

Overall debt levels of media companies remained little changed from the prior quarter. 

When the economy was in long-term expansion mode (up until the pandemic), companies were not shy about taking on large amounts of debt to finance operations and fuel growth. When macroeconomic conditions are rosy, companies are encouraged to take on cheap debt to invest in business and grow profits; however, when the macro backdrop deteriorates, debt gets more expensive to pay down, and a company could ultimately be at risk of default.

"Several fintech companies that facilitated high volumes of pandemic-related loans to businesses in 2020 had inadequate processes to detect fraud, according to a new report from the U.S. House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis.

The committee concluded in its report published Thursday that some fintech companies failed to stop ‚Äö√Ñ√∫obvious and preventable fraud‚Äö√Ñ√π in administering loans in the COVID-19 Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) ‚Äö√Ñ√∫leading to the needless loss of taxpayer dollars.‚Äö√Ñ√π

‚Äö√Ñ√∫Even as these companies failed in their administration of the program, they nonetheless accrued massive profits from program administration fees,‚Äö√Ñ√π said Rep. Jim Clyburn, the chair of the committee, in a statement.

The program closed to borrowers in May 2021 after lending about $800 billion. 

The committee opened an investigation into fintech companies Kabbage and Bluevine and their partner banks in May 2021 following reports they were linked to a disproportionately high number of fraudulent loans, and later expanded that investigation to include Blueacorn and Womply.

The report found internal systems to detect fraud were often lacking. Blueacorn employees who reviewed loans were told that each application should take less than 30 seconds to review, and that they did not need to apply as much scrutiny to high dollar loans, the committee said.

Womply‚Äö√Ñ√¥s lending partners accused the company of allowing ‚Äö√Ñ√∫rampant fraud‚Äö√Ñ√π to occur and described its fraud prevention practices as ‚Äö√Ñ√∫put together with duct tape and gum.‚Äö√Ñ√π

Kabbage, which was acquired by American Express in October 2020, likely approved loans with red flags because the loan program ‚Äö√Ñ√∫imposed minimal risk on lenders who approved questionable applications,‚Äö√Ñ√π the report said.

 Meanwhile, the committee observed that Bluevine‚Äö√Ñ√¥s lending partner, Celtic Bank, conducted oversight of Bluevine‚Äö√Ñ√¥s anti-fraud controls and prompted the fintech to introduce manual review processes, after which it observed a steep decline in fraud.

"Exxon plans to raise spending in 2023 closer to $25 billion. 

Dec 8 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) on Thursday said it will raise spending next year closer to the top end of its $20 billion-$25 billion annual guidance and expand investments to curb carbon emissions. 

Exxon led record gains among oil majors in the second and third quarters this year, aided by its highly criticized decision during the COVID-19 pandemic to double down on fossil fuels as European competitors shifted to renewables. 

The strategy boosted its shares by more than 60% this year - far ahead of rivals Shell PLC (SHEL.L) and BP PLC (BP.L) - as oil prices rose to their highest levels since 2008 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Schlumberger changes its name to SLB, rebrands as it eyes lower-carbon future

(Reuters) -Top oilfield services firm SLB anticipates oil and gas offshore activity will surpass levels seen before the COVID-19 pandemic, as strong demand and pricing drive new investment into the oil and gas industry.

"Suit: MGM paid problem gambler to not report online glitches. 

In a lawsuit filed Wednesday in state Superior Court in Middlesex County, Antar accuses the defendants of fraud, racketeering and other transgressions. In his lawsuit, Antar claims he alerted numerous employees and officials with the gambling companies to the fact that there was a serious, recurring problem with disconnections, but that they knowingly kept malfunctioning games available to the public because they were too profitable to take down.

He says his complaints were made to local supervisors and VIP hosts, an online complaint portal, and even to the president of the casino and the CEO of its parent company.

He also claims the companies paid him near-daily bonuses totaling $30,000 a month to keep him playing and to entice him not to report problems with the games to the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement.

"How Microsoft‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Xbox is offering gamers a way to fight climate change. 

That‚Äö√Ñ√¥s why I was intrigued by this article in Ars Technica, about Microsoft‚Äö√Ñ√¥s recently announced changes to its Xbox gaming console that the company says will make it more eco-friendly.

The changes, Microsoft said Wednesday, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫will create opportunities for our collective community of gamers to make choices to reduce environmental impact while gaming.‚Äö√Ñ√π

Essentially, the company is rolling out a power-saving feature that will allow a console linked to the internet to read local energy consumption data provided by the user‚Äö√Ñ√¥s nearest power grid. The console then uses that data to schedule Xbox updates and maintenance for times when the most renewable energy is available.

Microsoft claims this ‚Äö√Ñ√∫decreases fossil fuel dependency and CO2 emissions‚Äö√Ñ√π and makes Xbox the first ‚Äö√Ñ√∫carbon-aware‚Äö√Ñ√π gaming console. Now you can fight climate change while updating ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Elden Ring‚Äö√Ñ√π or the game of your choice.

I should add the caveat that while it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s great that Microsoft seems to be embracing the ‚Äö√Ñ√∫green gaming‚Äö√Ñ√π movement by helping people take climate measures, Microsoft‚Äö√Ñ√¥s data centers still require a lot of power to run.",Microsoft revealed a power-saving feature for its Xbox console that it says will help gamers fight climate change.

"EPA Administrator Michael Regan and celebrity couple Idris and Sabrina Elba have been scheduled to attend a climate change trip to Africa with the EPA amid fallout from the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. The trip was postponed due to the EPA's emergency response to the February 3 derailment, which caused massive plumes of dark smoke and industrial chemicals to be emitted from five train cars. Regan was previously scheduled to visit sub-Saharan Africa alongside the Elbas and noted the purported impact of climate change on the region. The EPA has threatened to issue several climate announcements during the diplomatic mission, including requiring Norfolk Southern to clean contaminated soil and water, reimburse the EPA for cleaning services that will be offered to residents and businesses, and attend public meetings to update residents on the cleanup process.

"‚Äö√Ñ√∫The Chinese also lose a lot of ships and aircraft, so it's costly all around.‚Äö√Ñ√π

There was, however, one glaring deficiency on the U.S. side, which months later would be echoed in a display of Russia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s embarrassingly flawed plan to invade and subjugate Ukraine ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ namely a critical shortage of certain kinds of precision munitions.

Ukraine is primarily a ground war with stationary targets that can be attacked by cruise missiles and drones, which, as the war dragged on much longer that Russian President Vladimir Putin planned, began to be in short supply.

 ‚Äö√Ñ√∫We‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve seen similar war games done by government agencies, including one where the U.K.‚Äö√Ñ√¥s third division exhausted national stockpiles in just over a week.‚Äö√Ñ√π

The war in Ukraine exposed not only Russia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s inability to produce more precision munitions, in part due to sanctions from the West, but also gaps in the capabilities of American defense contractors to ramp up assembly lines on a wartime schedule to replace the stocks of armaments the Pentagon was pulling out of U.S. inventory and shipping to Ukraine.

‚Äö√Ñ√∫ ‚Äö√Ñ√∫It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s depleted stocks of some weapon systems and munitions, Stingers [anti-aircraft missiles], for example, M-777 howitzers, 155 mm ammunition and Howitzers, Javelin anti-tank missile systems.‚Äö√Ñ√π

Rearming the U.S. military comes with an array of impediments, including increased demand, labor shortages, supply chain constraints, and a shortage of rare earth metals, of which China has a near monopoly.

But one of the bigger problems is the inability of Congress to pass a defense budget on time, instead relying on short-term funding bills known as continuing resolutions that freeze spending at last year‚Äö√Ñ√¥s levels and prevent the Pentagon from entering into multiyear contracts, which defense companies need in order to invest in new production lines. But defense contractors shouldn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t have to guess what the Pentagon wants to buy, say leaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee who last month proposed an amendment to the annual defense policy bill to give the Pentagon emergency procurement powers to cut through peacetime red tape and replenish missiles and other munitions in wartime quantities.

Nineteen attorneys general are investigating the six largest Wall Street banks over their involvement in an international green energy banking alliance, arguing it hurts their states.

As part of a civil investigation announced Wednesday led by Republican Missouri Attorney General and U.S. Senate candidate Eric Schmitt, the attorneys general are asking the investment giants for documents related to their participation in the United Nations's Net-Zero Banking Alliance ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ a coalition of global banks that voluntarily commit to aligning their portfolios so as to be net-zero by 2050 in accordance with the Paris climate agreement.



The investigation represents a much larger, concerted effort among state Republican officials to counter green finance practices, including environmental, social, and governance investment principles, for disfavoring fossil fuels relative to alternative energy sources. 

The banking alliance was set up ""to starve companies engaged in fossil fuel-related activities of credit on national and international markets,"" Schmitt said in a statement. 

""Missouri farmers, oil leasing companies, and other businesses that are vital to Missouri‚Äö√Ñ√¥s and America‚Äö√Ñ√¥s economy will be unable to get a loan because of this alliance,‚Äö√Ñ√π said Schmitt, adding, ""These banks are accountable to American laws ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ we don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t let international bodies set the standards for our businesses.‚Äö√Ñ√π

Some companies are reformulating their products using cheaper ingredients to reduce their manufacturing costs, a stratagem some have dubbed skimpflation, according to consumer advocate Edgar Dworsky, the founder of Consumer World. 

But Customers who noticed the switch have flocked to the Smart Balance website in recent days to complain about the new formulation, calling it ""terrible,"" ""disgusting"" and ""undesirable.""

""We have been loyal Smart Balance customers for a long time, but something changed,"" one customer wrote as part of their one-star review on Monday. 

Skimpflation may save costs or even boost a company's bottom line, at least in the short term, but it also risks turning off consumers, who may seek alternatives that they view as providing a better value or quality, Dworsky said.

Brand marketing builds your reputation and recognition, and it helps establish relationships with your target audiences. Once you have a brand story, you can use different marketing strategies to deliver the message, and the deeper you understand your audiences' informational needs and emotional responses, the more you can focus your marketing programs and the more efficiently you can allocate your marketing budget.

The lawsuit had been filed in 2019, accusing the companies of using aggressive marketing to get thousands of kids on e-cigarettes.

Credit reporting agency TransUnion is testing a new token-based technology to prevent sensitive customer information from being shared whenever a third party requests a credit report, the vendor behind the tech first told Axios. 

Why it matters: If adopted, the token could allow TransUnion to encrypt customers' sensitive data and limit its spread ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ adding another layer of security to the hordes of data the credit reporting agency collects on people.
‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ Spring Labs, the startup behind TransUnion's data storage technique, plans to announce the partnership later today.

Details: Spring Labs' new service, TrueZero, encrypts sensitive user information in tokens before it lands on a client's servers.
‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ Once encrypted, the token ensures that ""no third party is able to steal or see any of this sensitive data,"" says Spring Labs CEO John Sun. 
‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ In TransUnion's case, that could mean any vendor requesting someone's credit report should see only relevant information like payment history or collections information.

In an Oct. 13 letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, FBI Director Christopher Wray and Delaware US Attorney David Weiss, Grassley (R-Iowa) questioned whether the bureau is fully investigating corruption allegations against first son Hunter Biden and demanded a ‚Äö√Ñ√∫full and unredacted FBI summary‚Äö√Ñ√π of Hunter business partner Tony Bobulinski‚Äö√Ñ√¥s October 2020 FBI interview.

According to Grassley, Bobulinski told investigators that Hunter and first brother James Biden were contracted to assist CEFC China Energy ‚Äö√Ñ√∫with potential business deals and investments while Joe Biden was Vice President; however, that work remained intentionally uncompensated while Joe Biden was Vice President.

‚Äö√Ñ√∫After Joe Biden left the Vice Presidency, the summary makes clear that Hunter Biden and James Biden worked with CEFC and affiliated individuals to compensate them for that past work and the benefits they procured for CEFC,‚Äö√Ñ√π Grassley went on. ‚Äö√Ñ√∫According to the summary, Hunter Biden, James Biden and their business associates created a joint venture that would serve as a vehicle to accomplish that financial compensation, and that arrangement was made sometime after a meeting in Miami between Hunter Biden and CEFC officials in February 2017.‚Äö√Ñ√π

 If CEFC lends more, they need to know the interest rate for the subsequent loan(s).‚Äö√Ñ√π

The $5 million was originally meant to be sent through the joint venture, dubbed SinoHawk and co-owned by Oneida, a holding company made up of five LLCs, two of which were controlled by Hunter and James Biden.

However, Grassley said, the money had not been sent at the time of Zhao‚Äö√Ñ√¥s email to Bobulinski, and ‚Äö√Ñ√∫James Biden considered calling CEFC officials and threatening to withdraw Biden family support from future deals.‚Äö√Ñ√π

The following month, in August 2017, $5 million was wired from ‚Äö√Ñ√∫a company connected to CEFC‚Äö√Ñ√π to Hudson West III, a company jointly owned at the time by Hunter Biden‚Äö√Ñ√¥s law firm Owasco and Coldharbour Capital LLC, which Grassley and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) tied to another CEFC executive, Gongwen Dong, in a September 2020 report.

 

The first family‚Äö√Ñ√¥s arrangements with CEFC are among the most scrutinized of Hunter Biden‚Äö√Ñ√¥s overseas business interests after a May 13, 2017 email ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ also revealed by The Post in 2020 ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ showed that Bobulinski, Hunter Biden, and two other business partners planned split equity in a planned business venture with the company four ways.

According to the email, each of the foursome would get 20% of the shares in the new company, with 10% going to James Biden and the remaining 10% ‚Äö√Ñ√∫held by H for the big guy?‚Äö√Ñ√π ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ a phrase Bobulinski and another partner, James Gilliar, used to refer to Joe Biden.

The president has repeatedly denied ever discussing Hunter‚Äö√Ñ√¥s overseas business arrangements with his offspring, a stance that has come under scrutiny due to evidence gathered from the first son‚Äö√Ñ√¥s abandoned laptop.

‚Äö√Ñ√∫The Justice Department and FBI must come clean to Congress and the American people with respect to the steps they have taken, or failed to take, relating to the Hunter Biden investigation,‚Äö√Ñ√π Grassley wrote.

Hackers are utilizing a discontinued web server to launch attacks on energy grid infrastructure, Microsoft has warned, with the initial attack discovered on the Indian grid, carried out by Chinese hackers. 

According to the software giant, the Boa server was used in routers, security cameras and popular software development kits. The company warned that the components represent a ‚Äö√Ñ√∫supply chain risk that may affect millions of organizations and devices.‚Äö√Ñ√π

‚Äö√Ñ√∫Without developers managing the Boa web server, its known vulnerabilities could allow attackers to silently gain access to networks by collecting information from files,‚Äö√Ñ√π Microsoft said.

‚Äö√Ñ√∫Moreover, those affected may be unaware that their devices run services using the discontinued Boa web server, and that firmware updates and downstream patches do not address its known vulnerabilities.‚Äö√Ñ√π

Power grids, as critical infrastructure, are high-value targets for hackers.

Earlier this year, the Department of Energy began work on shoring up the defenses of the U.S. grid along with supply chain suspecting state-sponsored actors from Russia and China might target the infrastructure.

"A new report from the Justice Department has revealed that an estimated $420 billion in COVID-19-related spending may have been wasted through fraud and corruption. The report found that $280 billion of relief was stolen through identity theft scams and fraudulent loan applications, and another $123 billion was wasted through mismanagement and misappropriation. Over $1.15 trillion of this relief was paid directly to individual recipients either through stimulus checks or through benefits programs such as rental assistance or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

"Researchers detect new ""callback phishing"" scam targeting retail, legal companies. 

Palo Alto Networks has investigated several incidents involving a data extortion gang using a growing social engineering tactic to extort retailers and other businesses out of hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to a report Monday. The report highlights the range of threats retailers, other businesses and consumers are up against heading into the hectic holiday season ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ and the depths hackers will go to make sure they find success.

Driving the news: Researchers at Palo Alto Networks said they've uncovered an ongoing hacking campaign from a group known as both ""Luna Moth"" and ""Silent Ransom"" that ditches traditional malware attacks for phone calls. 
‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ Once inside, the hacker blanks out the screen so the victim can't see their actions and moves quickly to steal files and personal data from the device.
‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ The hacker follows up with an extortion email, detailing the data that was stolen and demanding payment to keep the hacker from leaking the data online.

The intrigue: The data extortion group behind these callback phishing attacks is suspected of having ties to the defunct Conti ransomware gang, a Russian group known for its attacks on hospital systems and other critical infrastructure.

Threat level: Researchers anticipate ""callback phishing attacks to increase in popularity due to the low per-target cost, low risk of detection and fast monetization,"" the report says.

"A new government report has found that housing starts in June were down 8% from May's revised rate of 1,559 million units, and that permits for single-family home construction rose to 922,000, up 2.2%.

However, rising interest rates and supply challenges are still threats to production, as labor shortages and rising costs of imported raw materials could cause delays in new builds.

Jason Haas, who penned the Bank of America report, said players are getting increasingly turned off by a slew of new releases that flooded the market and decreased secondary market values of cards. 

As for secondary market pricing concerns, Williams noted that Hasbro doesn't derive money from card resales and that if prices for recently released products rise significantly, it means ""we're not adequately meeting customer demand and we are making millions of players unhappy at their lack of ability to acquire the cards they want to play.""

She said Hasbro prints and reprints cards based on demand both during presales and once the product has been released.

""Like any market for any other collectible products, some products and individual cards do become more collectible than others and values can change over time due to a multitude of external factors, many entirely unrelated to the number of cards,"" she said. 

But Cocks said that he doesn't think raising prices on Magic cards is the answer to growing the business over the long term.

NEW YORK, Oct 6 (Reuters) - CME Group on Thursday said it will expand its suite of cryptocurrency pricing data to include three more digital currencies, a move that lays a foundation for more crypto-related financial products, such as new futures and options contracts. 

The futures exchange operator said it, along with cryptocurrency benchmark indices provider CF Benchmarks, will begin publishing daily settlement prices and real-time pricing data for the cryptocurrencies Avalanche, Filecoin and Tezos, on Oct. 31. 

While the rates themselves are not tradeable, they increase transparency for digital currencies and can be used to create regulated products, such as bitcoin futures, which CME launched in 2018 and have become popular with institutional investors looking to gain cryptocurrency exposure and hedge risk. 

""These new benchmarks are designed to allow traders, institutions and other users to access a much broader range of cryptocurrencies through a suite of products they are already familiar with, allowing them to confidently and more accurately manage cryptocurrency price risk, value portfolios or create structured products like ETFs,"" he said, referring to exchange-traded funds.","CME expands its crypto pricing data to include Tezos, other coins",CME,2023-05-09,positive,0.7722276,0.2052395,0.02253295,2023-05-09,185.69000244140625,186.3800048828125,184.55999755859375,184.6300048828125,177.15086364746094,722200,CME

"Bank stocks in the U.S. and Europe tumbled on Wednesday as the global financial system continued to reckon with the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, the largest bank failure since 2008. Shares of Credit Suisse fell more than 26% in early trading after a top backer said he would not be able to provide any more cash to support the Swiss bank.

"The recent bank crisis was different from past experiences, with deposits being given to the bank with a maturity as short as 24 hours. The government distributed massive sums of money to consumers during Covid, which was immediately deposited in bank accounts until depositors decided how much and when to spend. These excess reserves earned virtually nothing at the Federal Reserve, so banks invested the funds in longer term Treasury bonds, perfectly safe from default. The Fed quickly raised rates 475 basis points and depositors discovered better uses for their money and started withdrawing funds. Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), the most notable recent bank failure, had to liquidate their safe (but low yield) investments, generating large losses that had to be covered with their capital. Credit conditions have been quite favorable for small firms since the Fed instituted Zero Interest-Rate Policy (ZIRP), a policy not good for savers but a real boon to borrowers.

"The Federal Reserve is facing criticism for missing what observers say were clear signs that Silicon Valley Bank was at high risk of collapsing into the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history. Critics point to many red flags surrounding the bank, including its rapid growth since the pandemic, its unusually high level of uninsured deposits and its many investments in long-term government bonds and mortgage-backed securities, which tumbled in value as interest rates rose. The Fed may focus more on boosting confidence in the financial system than on its long term drive to tame inflation, with the collapse of the two large banks fueling anxiety about other regional banks. The latest government report on inflation, released Tuesday, shows that price increases remain far higher than the Fed prefers, putting Chair Jerome Powell in a tougher spot. On Monday, Powell announced that the Fed would review its supervision of Silicon Valley to understand how it might have better managed its regulation of the bank.",The Federal Reserve is facing stinging criticism for missing what observers say were clear signs that Silicon Valley Bank was at high risk of collapsing into the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history.,SBNY,2023-05-24,positive,0.752103,0.22374596,0.024151087,2023-05-24,0.13439999520778656,0.13439999520778656,0.11400000005960464,0.12300000339746475,0.12300000339746475,1126087,SBNY

It marks the end of an era where oil companies would search globally for oil to add to their booked reserves. Chevron is also ramping up spending 25% to $14 billion this year - a figure that is still well below its pre-pandemic budget.

"A train carrying hazardous chemicals derailed in Raymond, Minnesota, on Thursday, the latest such accident in recent months. The derailment is so close to the Ohio derailment that it has raised questions about train safety and whether new regulations are needed to prevent more of these dangerous incidents from happening in the future. Human error and track defects are two of the biggest causes of derailments, and equipment failures have also played a role in the past. Trains increased in length by 25 percent between 2008 and 2019, a decision that was aimed at reducing the staffing needed per car. However, rail companies have slashed worker numbers in recent years and their resistance to more costly equipment upgrades has contributed to these types of accidents.

"Lawmakers in the Senate Banking Committee debated Tuesday over the causes of the meltdowns at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, with Republicans arguing that tougher rules for midsize banks would have kept the institutions from failing and Democrats arguing that the recent meltdown leaves little ambiguity on the need for revamped rules. The cost of SVB‚Äôs failure to the government‚Äô‚ÄôÔøΩs Deposit Insurance Fund is roughly $20 billion, and the FDIC will also embark on a ‚Äúcomprehensive‚Äù review of bank deposit insurance. The Fed and FDIC are investigating how the firms‚Äô back-to-back failures triggered so much panic in the financial system that regulators had to scramble to launch emergency efforts to prevent even more damage. Twelve senators are urging the Fed to impose tougher rules on banks with assets totaling $100 to $250 billion, the tier on which Congress rolled back some restrictions during the Trump administration through a bipartisan 2018 vote. Republicans said regulators were ‚Äúasleep at the wheel‚Äù and disputed the idea that the ‚Äútailoring‚Äù of the rules established after the 2008 financial crisis allowed SVB to slip through the cracks. Democrats argued that a 2018 move to weaken rules for banks contributed to the panic.","Silicon Valley Bank‚Äôs failure was a ‚Äútextbook case of mismanagement‚Äù that shows that banks with more than $100 billion in assets may need tougher oversight, regulators told a Senate committee.",SBNY,2023-06-01,positive,0.740779,0.23314245,0.026078563,2023-06-01,0.12049999833106995,0.13199999928474426,0.11699999868869781,0.12099999934434891,0.12099999934434891,913774,SBNY

There are many reasons why biotech companies are often unprofitable for years, including:

¬∑ High R&D costs:R&D in the biotech field is expensive and time-consuming.

¬∑ Regulatory Approval:The process may take years to complete before a drug can be sold (assuming its approved).

¬∑ Competition: Several companies often work on a solution to the same health problem ‚Äì something that is good for consumers but can be tough for biotech companies.

At Hewlett Packard Enterprise, at least 70% of employees in internal surveys indicate they do not want to be at the office five days a week, requiring new ways of extending corporate culture. ‚ÄúMaintaining culture is the biggest challenge in a hybrid environment,‚Äù says Alan May, executive vice president and chief people officer for HPE. ‚ÄúOur ‚Äòin-person- with-a-purpose‚Äô philosophy is especially important for our newer employees with options for in-person trainings and mentoring sessions.‚Äù

At Robert Half, hybrid work has stirred high levels of collaboration to ensure everyone is where they want ‚Äî and need ‚Äî to be. Robert Half‚Äôs own survey finds nearly three in 10 workers (29%) said their biggest concern about hybrid work models is that ‚Äúthey create an unequal playing field for career progression and opportunities.‚Äù

It‚Äôs important that companies ‚Äúmake a concerted effort to create equal opportunities for all employees to grow and develop, network, and build authentic relationships with colleagues ‚Äî regardless of where they work,‚Äù says Smith. ‚ÄúManagers can foster this is by having consistent check-in and goal discussions with their direct reports, hosting in-person and virtual team building events for colleagues to connect Inviting feedback on areas of improvement and acting on it, when possible.‚Äù

This is a need not lost on hybrid-intensive companies such as HPE. ‚ÄúUnconditional inclusion is a key tenet of our culture, and that includes providing equal opportunity to employees no matter their working arrangement,‚Äù says May. ‚ÄúWhile this equity and inclusion process requires continuous improvement, learning, and careful management, we have reinforced the need for our leaders to adjust their mindsets and how they engage their teams.‚Äù

Recall Tesla CEO Elon Musk called ESG a ""scam"" last year after the electric-vehicle maker was excluded from an S&P Global ESG index. 


ESG is an outrageous scam! 
Musk followed up with a tweet earlier this week that said, ""The S in ESG stands for Satanic.""

However, in the interview, Fink said BlackRock took in $230 billion in 2022 from US clients, and the outflows were small, though he takes the issue ""very seriously"" and was trying to address the negative mood around ESG:


""We are doing everything we can to change the narrative."" 


While Fink tries to save the ESG narrative, a former BlackRock senior executive, Terrence R. Keeley, recently opined in a WSJ article that after ""trillions of dollars have poured into environmental, social and governance funds in recent years ... there is astonishingly little evidence of its tangible benefit."" 

Perhaps what Fink's terrified about is a run on BlackRock funds because state officials and many others are realizing ESG investing is just another globalist 'scam.'

‚Ä¢ The Southwest Airlines Board of Directors has appointed an Operations Review Committee to work with management to review the events and the company‚Äôs response

Southwest is also pledging to keep the public updated with recurring progress reports as milestones are achieved.

The airline is currently allocating $1 billion for IT-related investments, upgrades and maintenance.

"Buttigieg pledges 'extraordinary effort' as Southwest Airlines cancels ...

Late Tuesday, Southwest CEO Bob Jordan had his first on-camera appearance about the problems, in which continuing bad weather quickly overwhelmed Southwest‚Äôs internal scheduling system, leaving crews stranded and planes parked as the system struggled to match people to equipment. 

Just before the Labor Day weekend, DOT published a dashboard showing each airline‚Äôs cancellation and refund policies , a move which prompted many airlines to make those policies more consumer-friendly, such as offering more generous hotel and meal vouchers when flights get canceled or significantly delayed and more flexibility to reschedule flights. 

Rep. Rick Larsen (D-Wash.), who will be the top Democrat on the House Transportation Committee next year, on Tuesday said he spoke with officials at Southwest, who told him cancellations as of Christmas Eve are ‚Äúdeemed controllable,‚Äù meaning passengers are entitled to refunds and reimbursements as a result of the airlines‚Äô meltdown. 

Southwest, like other airlines, received billions in Covid-19 pandemic relief money ‚Äî roughly $3 billion in grants and low-interest loans for the airline alone ‚Äî with the understanding that the money would help keep people on the job and position the carrier to be ready when travel demand returned.","The Transportation secretary upped the pressure on Southwest, pointedly saying the travel meltdown goes beyond a weather-driven issue.",LUV,2023-06-29,positive,0.7363734,0.24262668,0.020999897,2023-06-29,35.470001220703125,35.970001220703125,35.27000045776367,35.95000076293945,35.52609634399414,8144800,LUV

According to flight tracking service FlightAware, Southwest Airlines canceled 2,909 flights on Monday ‚Äî 71% of its flight schedule. 

Other airlines endured cancellations over the past few days, but nothing compares to Southwest.

Southwest customers posted on social media their discontent with the airline from hourslong lines at the San Jose airport, ‚Äúabsolute chaos‚Äù at SFO and a ‚Äútotal collapse‚Äù at Oakland.

The mishap triggered an examination from the Department of Transportation to determine if the airline is taking care of its customers.

At a press conference in Houston, Southwest spokesman Jay McVay said cancellations snowballed as storm systems moved across the country, leaving flight crews and planes out of place.

‚ÄúSo we‚Äôve been chasing our tails, trying to catch up and get back to normal safely, which is our number one priority, as quickly as we could,‚Äù he said. Unlike many other U.S. air carriers, Southwest operates on what is known as a point-to-point flight route system, meaning a plane will fly consecutive routes, picking up different crews along the way.

In normal times, this can allow Southwest to operate more flights over a given 24-hour period than other carriers, said Scott Meyerowitz, executive editor of The Points Guy travel site. 

Casey Murray, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, said Southwest had not adequately prepared flights for the storm, which hampered ground transportation and maintenance vehicles.

"As electric vehicles become more common, safety concerns are increasing over their weight and safety risks for other drivers. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) tests show that the vehicles hold up well in a simulated crash, with their batteries making them heavier and more dangerous.

Cantwell said she has spoken to Buttigieg and Southwest CEO Bob Jordan about her concerns, adding that the hearings, to be conducted as part of a Federal Aviation Administration budget reauthorization process, also will examine airline operations. The carrier was forced to halt departures after a third-party vendor, IBM, experienced a brief outage in its service that provides weather data to Southwest - a problem blamed in many of the 39% of Southwest departures that were delayed that day, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware.com. 

Southwest Airlines appeared to have righted its operations this week while seeking to make amends to customers caught in the holiday meltdown. 

Southwest‚Äôs troubles could ultimately benefit travelers across the industry as airlines look to avoid a similar meltdown, said Dean Headley, co-author of the Airline Quality Rating published by Wichita State University,

Why it matters: Nearly 1 in 4 U.S. flights was canceled or delayed between January and September 2022, according to the Department of Transportation.
‚Ä¢ There's no more vivid example of how bad things can get than Southwest's recent debacle, which affected nearly 1 million travelers at the height of the holiday travel season.

What's happening: Southwest's recent failure has reignited discussions about a proposed Airline Passengers' Bill of Rights.
‚Ä¢ Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) is re-upping a bill he introduced in 2021 that would essentially ensure that airlines give refunds and compensation for extra costs caused by delayed or canceled flights and lost luggage. 

Meanwhile: Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is threatening to crack down on Southwest if the airline fails to take care of affected customers.
‚Ä¢ ""No amount of financial compensation can fully make up for passengers who missed moments with their families that they can never get back ‚Äî Christmas, birthdays, weddings, and other special events,"" Buttigieg wrote in a recent letter to Southwest CEO Bob Jordan.
‚Ä¢ ""That's why it is so critical for Southwest to begin by reimbursing passengers for those costs that can be measured in dollars and cents.""

Where it stands: Southwest says it has largely resumed its normal schedule, with a 99.1% completion rate over the New Year's weekend.
‚Ä¢ The airline is still working to reunite customers with their lost luggage and to reimburse passengers caught up in the chaos.
‚Ä¢ In a ""goodwill gesture,"" Southwest is offering 25,000 ""Rapid Rewards"" points worth $300 toward a future flight ‚Äî on top of other refunds and reimbursements it has already paid out.

Zoom in: For Southwest passengers like Zack Griff, a senior writer at travel site The Points Guy, such payouts can add up.
‚Ä¢ He got a refund for his canceled Southwest flight, reimbursement for an alternate flight, a $250 travel voucher, plus the 25,000 rewards points, he tells Axios. 

The big picture: The Department of Transportation had already been turning up the heat on airlines in the wake of travel disruptions last summer.
‚Ä¢ It's proposing new rules that would enhance airline refund policies and require carriers to be more transparent about surprise add-on fees. 
‚Ä¢ From January 2020 through September 2022, airlines issued $29.3 billion in cash refunds ‚Äî just under $1 billion per month, according to Airlines for America.",The Southwest debacle could lead to big consumer-friendly changes,LUV,2023-07-05,positive,0.76145613,0.22043821,0.018105736,2023-07-05,36.95000076293945,37.369998931884766,36.45000076293945,37.220001220703125,36.781124114990234,8215400,LUV

Critics say the contract that did not receive backing from enough union members lacked sufficient levels of paid leave for rail workers. 

The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, which represents 29,000 people, said last week that 53.5 percent of its members had voted to ratify the deal offered by the coalition of the nation's biggest freight railroads, including Union Pacific, CSX, Norfolk Southern, BNSF and Kansas City Southern. That's part of the reason why they don't want to offer paid sick time.

"A new report from the Boston Globe has found that a utility plan to replace gas with climate-friendly fuels is deeply flawed. The report suggests that using so-called green hydrogen to heat homes and other buildings would require so much electricity to simply manufacture the gas that it would consume all the wind power Massachusetts expects to be generating by the end of the decade. Green hydrogen does not produce greenhouse gas emissions when burned, making it an attractive fuel of the future.

Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Lina Khan said large corporations offer environmental or diversity concessions to avoid antitrust enforcement but that her agency rejects such deals. 

When asked during a Tuesday appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee by Sen.

Leading health experts have called for the ties between junk food and sports teams to be ‚Äúsevered for good‚Äù after Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool announced commercial deals with Coca-Cola on the same day.

"Not only has surging retail crime forced drug stores, major retailers, and grocers to engage in dystopian looking security measures, it's hitting their bottom lines. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon explained that 2022 didn't bring any reduction in retail crimes such as shoplifting, organized or otherwise. 

He added that, without action to address the shoplifting surge, ""prices will be higher, and/or stores will close.""

Target is also facing tough decisions as a result of thefts, reporting earlier in 2022 that they were seeing 50 percent more shoplifting incidents at a cost of some $400 million.

The result of increased retail crime ‚Äî whether the organized smash-and-grabs by groups of people or one-off thefts by individuals ‚Äî means that, as Walmart's CEO noted, prices will increase to make up for losses and locations that continually get hit will likely close.

The nation's three biggest for-profit hospital chains each had positive operating margins that exceeded pre-COVID levels for most of the pandemic, including as recently as the third quarter this year, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of SEC filings. 

Why it matters: Hospital operators are asking Congress to stop scheduled Medicare payment cuts and provide more federal relief, saying they're facing tough economic times.
‚Ä¢ But the results for HCA Healthcare, Tenet Healthcare and Community Health Systems paint a more optimistic picture for those companies. 

What they found: Profits from patient care and other operations plus pandemic relief funds left the three chains with operating margins ahead of pre-COVID levels for 9 out of 11 quarters during the health crisis, per KFF.

"Billionaire hedge fund manager Christopher Hohn, an investor in Google, admits there is no labor shortage in the United States tech industry despite claims that more foreign visa workers are needed to fill jobs. Hohn‚Äôs letter inadvertently admits there is no shortage of tech workers to hire in the U.S. despite industry claims that more foreign visa workers are necessary to fill jobs. Hohn‚Äôs TCI Fund Management holds more than $6 billion in Google stock through the corporation‚Äôs parent company, Alphabet Inc.

The labor market for tech workers is partially inflated by a massive pool of foreign visa workers that are imported annually, mostly on H-1B visas, L-1 visas, and OPT visas to take coveted white-collar STEM jobs that would otherwise go to American graduates and professionals.

For instance, in 2021, Google executives sought to outsource more than 9,400 tech jobs to foreign H-1B visa workers ‚Äî making Google the third largest H-1B outsourcer of American jobs that year, just behind Indian firms Cognizant and Tata Consulting Services.

Today, as tech companies across the U.S. announce layoffs, there are an estimated 80,000 Indian nationals on H-1B visas or L-1 visas who have been fired from their jobs.

Claims from the tech industry have helped drive a push by Republican and Democrat lawmakers in recent years to reward the largest tech conglomerates who have relied on the H-1B visa program to outsource white-collar jobs.

Last year, Reps. Don Bacon (R-NE), Larry Bucshon (R-IN), John Curtis (R-UT), Tom Emmer (R-MN), Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA), Bill Johnson (R-OH), Pete Stauber (R-MN), and William Timmons (R-SC) joined 76 House Democrats to co-sponsor the green card giveaway. More than 100 House Republicans signed on as co-sponsors that year to promote the green card giveaway, including Reps. Jim Banks (R-IN), Ken Buck (R-CO), Ted Budd (R-NC), Dan Crenshaw, Rodney Davis (R-IL), Lance Gooden (R-TX), Michael Guest (R-MS), Kevin Hern (R-OK), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Thomas Massie (R-KY), Markwayne Mullin (R-OK), Scott Perry (R-PA), and Elise Stefanik (R-NY), among others.",Billionaire hedge fund manager Christopher Hohn admits that there is no labor shortage in the United States tech industry.,GOOGL,2023-08-10,positive,0.7718195,0.20760083,0.02057971,2023-08-10,131.32000732421875,132.0500030517578,129.4499969482422,129.69000244140625,129.69000244140625,20857800,GOOGL
"Election Disruptions Loom as Social Media Giants Likely to Resist Turkey's New Law. 

Critics of the law say it could tighten the government's grip on social media, one of the last bastions of free speech and dissent in Turkey after 20 years of rule by President Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling AK Party (AKP). 

Social media companies have so far been able to comply with the 2020 law by setting up small corporate entities in Turkey that they could easily pull out if pressured, said Yaman Akdeniz, cyber rights expert and professor at Istanbul Bilgi University. 

Under the new law, over-the-network service providers such as Meta-owned messaging application WhatsApp, which is ubiquitous in Turkey, are also required to establish a local company.","US News is a recognized leader in college, grad school, hospital, mutual fund, and car rankings.

"U.S. Weapons Stockpile Threatened by Chip Shortage Amid Ukraine War. 

Supply chain issues and a shortage of microchips due to the ongoing war in Ukraine may threaten the U.S. weapons stockpile. 

James D. Taiclet, president, chair and CEO of Lockheed Martin, said during a recent earnings call that the company ""continue[s] to anticipate growth over the long-term, but with residual pandemic impacts and supply chain challenges continuing, we now expect to return to growth in 2024, with 2023 sales being approximately equal to our 2022 outlook.""

The remarks come amid the war that has continued in Ukraine since Russia first launched its invasion on February 24. 

Dr. Robert Handfield, a professor of supply chain management at North Carolina State University, told Newsweek in April that supply chain issues could persist for the next few years due to the Russia-Ukraine war.","""We've overcome some significant headwinds...from transitioning out of Russia to record inflation and a strained supply chain,"" said the CEO of Raytheon.",LMT,2023-08-15,negative,0.75999504,0.22115508,0.018849922,2023-08-15,448.0,450.0,443.2799987792969,443.5799865722656,437.5195007324219,725300,LMT

As many as 81.2% of retailers said that the ‚Äúviolence and aggression‚Äù associated with organized retail crime increased in the past year, according to a survey from the National Retail Federation, while nearly 90% of respondents said that the pandemic worsened the risk for their companies through higher degrees of shoplifting, employee theft, and organized crime.

"Crisis Management Lessons From Southwest Airlines' Meltdown. 

As Southwest Airlines struggles to recover from its weather-related meltdown, crisis management and crisis communication lessons have already emerged that business leaders should keep in mind before they have to confront their own crisis.

Patrick, a lecturer at San Diego State University‚Äôs Fowler College of Business, said via email. When travel conditions are normal, this allows it to fly more routes in a 24-hour span than other airlines,‚Äù according to the Dallas Morning News. 

‚ÄúWhile the airline‚Äôs executives have kept largely out of sight, refusing to provide interviews, passenger horror stories, unfavorable comparisons with other airlines, and employee complaints have instead painted a picture of chaos and helplessness at Southwest,‚Äù he noted.

Oct 21 (Reuters) - Chinese battery giant CATL (300750.SZ) has slowed its planning for investment in battery plants in North America on concern that new U.S. rules on sourcing battery materials will drive costs higher, two people with knowledge of the matter said. 

But CATL executives have slowed the process of vetting sites for potential new plants in North America since late August when the United States imposed tough new restrictions on the sourcing of material used in EV batteries, two people, who spoke on condition they not be named, told Reuters. 

The IRA requires automakers to have 50% of critical minerals used in EV batteries sourced from North America or U.S. allies by 2024, rising to 80% by the end of 2026. But the new U.S. rules on sourcing battery materials had become a ""banana peel"" that have slowed the company's investment plans, one said.","Chinese battery giant CATL has slowed its planning for investment in battery plants in North America on concern that new U.S. rules on sourcing battery materials will drive costs higher, two people with knowledge of the matter said.",F,2023-08-23,positive,0.8044733,0.17377093,0.021755729,2023-08-23,11.819999694824219,11.970000267028809,11.800000190734863,11.960000038146973,11.466965675354004,30437700,F

They could move GM closer to making money on affordably priced electric vehicles such as the Chevrolet Equinox SUV, which will have a starting price of about $30,000, roughly half the price of a Tesla Model Y.

"A new quarterly report from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has revealed that US banks lost $472 billion in deposits in the first quarter, the largest since 1984. The decline was largely due to movement by uninsured depositors who were above the $250,000-per account level backstopped by the FDIC, while insured deposits actually increased by $255 billion. The FDIC's report also shows that other lenders beyond Silicon Valley Bank experienced extreme stress during that time, as interest rates rose and depositors began moving their money elsewhere. Higher costs, in turn, cut into a key measure of profitability known as net interest margin, which declined 17% for all FDIC-insured institutions during the firstquarter.

The legislation bars sales of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to entities under the control, ownership or influence of the Chinese Communist Party, unless that oil will not be exported to China. While some of the oil that was sold from the strategic reserve ended up in other countries, including China, Kloza said the impact on the U.S. economy would have been the same regardless of where those barrels went.

Some of the companies that were able to buy oil from the release are U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies.

What each side has to say:
‚Ä¢ Republicans argued the Biden administration‚Äôs move to sell off oil from the nation‚Äôs reserves last year was political ‚Äî and said that if it benefitted China, it was harmful to the nation‚Äôs security.
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs SPR is meant for true energy supply disruptions, like those caused by hurricanes and natural disasters, not to help China,‚Äù said House Energy and Commerce Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), according to a copy of her floor remarks. 
‚Ä¢ Meanwhile, Rep. Frank Pallone (N.J.), the energy panel‚Äôs top Democrat, said he also opposes exporting U.S. oil to China, but said the GOP measure did not adequately address that issue.

New fines levied by European regulators against Meta and Apple are the latest reminder that Big Tech companies must now maneuver between two wildly different regimes in the U.S. and the EU. 

The intrigue: In some cases, U.S. companies have had to make changes to business models or product design to comply with European law, resulting in significant differences between the products or services deployed on either side of the Atlantic.
‚Ä¢ For example, Amazon last December agreed to change some business practices around the way merchants can advertise their products on the Amazon website.

"Under Musk, half of Twitter workers may lose jobs in days.

Hiring is challenging for every industry, but especially tech. The industry has been a hotbed of hiring for years, even more so during the pandemic when stay-at-home regulations boosted demand for home entertainment, digital technology and e-commerce.

A cut this dramatic would upend the lives of thousands and undo years of work in recruitment, employee development and institutional knowledge at the company.

The layoff of so many employees could also present serious concerns about cybersecurity, IT and the overall stability of the platform, said Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities.

‚ÄúFifty percent layoffs is a potential backbreaker for Twitter,‚Äù he said.

Getting out from under so much debt as a mature company in a competitive sector will be difficult, Ives said.

Experts have been anticipating a rise in cases like Meyersberg's, which allege reverse discrimination, as some litigants are eager to translate the court's race-blind stance to the workplace.
