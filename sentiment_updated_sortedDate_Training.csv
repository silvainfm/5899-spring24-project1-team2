The case is In re Tesla Inc Securities Litigation, No. 18-04865.

The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to rule this year on conservative activists' challenge to Nasdaq's board diversity rule, which requires companies listed on the exchange to have diverse boards, or explain why they do not.

The rule was introduced in late 2020, after protests in the U.S. over racial injustice sparked discussion about corporate board diversity.

But the groups say it violates the Constitution by encouraging discrimination and violating companies' right to free speech.

Nasdaq has argued the rules level the playing field between large investors that have the resources to compile boards' demographic information and small investors who do not. 

U.S. law allows investors to sue over misleading offering materials, but only when their shares are ""traceable"" to the materials. 

The justices will consider how to apply that to direct listings, where unregistered insider shares and registered shares issued pursuant to offering materials are made available at the same time and are practically impossible to distinguish. 

Slack has argued the 9th Circuit's ruling conflicts with decisions by other courts and would allow investors to sue over offering materials without tracing their stock back to the applicable offering.","Some of the biggest securities cases of 2023 are surely yet to come, but major litigation is already on the docket.

Driving the news: Google told the court that tampering with Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects firms from liability for content their users post, would ""undercut a central building block of the internet."" 

Background: In Gonzalez v. Google relatives of victims of an ISIS attack are suing Google-owned YouTube for allegedly helping turn viewers into terrorists.
‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ Justice Clarence Thomas has suggested the court place new limits on the reach of Section 230.
‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ Plaintiffs argue that Section 230's protection does not extend to algorithmically created recommendations, since YouTube plays a role in deciding which videos to recommend to users.
‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ Google contends Section 230 protects YouTube's methods of organizing users' posts, and weakening the law would only make it harder to filter out terrorism content. A decision undermining Section 230 would make websites either remove potentially controversial material or shut their eyes to objectionable content to avoid knowledge of it,"" Google general counsel Halimah DeLaine Prado wrote in a blog post.

In the civil lawsuit, the DOJ alleges that over the course of nearly a decade, from 2014 through the present, AmerisourceBergen Corporation and two of its subsidiaries violated the Controlled Substances Act by failing to report to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) at least hundreds of thousands of suspicious orders of controlled substances, as required by law. 

The government‚Äö√Ñ√¥s complaint specifies several pharmacies for which AmerisourceBergen allegedly was aware of significant ""red flags"" suggesting the existence of diversion of prescription drugs to illicit markets, but that the company nevertheless continued to distribute drugs to the pharmacies for years and reported few suspicious orders to the DEA. 

""Even in these five hand-selected examples presented by the DOJ, AmerisourceBergen verified DEA registration and State Board of Pharmacy licenses before filling any orders, conducted extensive due diligence into these customers, reported every sale of every controlled substance to the DEA, and reported suspicious orders of controlled substances to the DEA for every one of these pharmacies ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ hundreds of suspicious orders in total. 

The company also stated that a federal judge recently held that AmerisourceBergen ""has maintained a compliance diversion control program in accordance with the law for decades,"" and said that the court decision ""addressed many of the same accusations that are made in this DOJ complaint while acknowledging the role of the DEA in controlled substance distribution with tools like manufacturing quotas ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ ultimately concluding that AmerisourceBergen had complied with the law.""

About 20 people including health care workers gathered outside of John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth on Thursday with red and yellow signs to protest the existence of a McDonald‚Äö√Ñ√¥s restaurant on the hospital‚Äö√Ñ√¥s first floor.

"The financial toll of right-wing backlash has been felt for America's mainstay brands, such as Target, Anheuser Busch, Kohl's and Anhe user Busch InBev, has caused a $28.7 billion loss in market value since the beginning of April due to their controversial decision to engage transgender social-media influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The controversy has shaved billions off Target's market capitalization, and Kohl‚Äö√Ñ√¥s stock prices due to the backlash. Meanwhile, Bud Light and Constellation Brands' Modelo have also been subject to a backlash, with Bud Light losing its perch as America's most imbibed brew. Separately, both Target and Kohal's stock prices have been pressured by right-leaning protests, and Target's stock has since recovered.

CVS said the agreement would fully resolve claims dating back a decade or more and that it would continue to defend against any litigation that the final agreement does not resolve.

"Rail strike threat recedes as Congress prepares to impose unpopular contract on unions. 

The move is sure to anger union rank-and-file who had rejected labor deals that their leaders reached earlier this fall. While the other eight unions had ratified the deals, sometimes by narrow margins, they had been prepared to honor the picket lines of any union that went on strike, meaning the railroads would have ground to a halt even if one union walked off the job.

The fact that Congress will move to impose the rejected tentative deals could be considered a limited victory for the unions: Congress could have instead voted to impose contracts that were worse off for the workers than the ones their members rejected.

Republicans in Congress who had introduced legislation before a September strike deadline to keep workers on the job were looking to impose a contract that would have been worse for union members, one based on recommendations of a panel that had been named this summer to try to reach a deal acceptable to both sides. 

But at least one of the unions that had rejected the deal, the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division [BMWED] that represents more than 20,000 track maintenance workers, said earlier that if Congress did impose a contract, it should include union demands for paid sick days.","The threat of a freight railroad strike that had been building in recent weeks receded quickly after President Joe Biden and Democratic leaders in Congress agreed late Monday to support legislation that would block a walk-out by more than 100,000 union members set for the end of next week.",CSX,10/27/2022 0:00,negative

Freight companies are preparing for what executives are calling a muted peak season, as dimming shipping demand from overstocked retailers ripples across U.S. shipping markets. 

Several big operators say they are seeing freight demand drop off rather than pick up heading into what is typically their busiest period of the year. 

DAT Solutions LLC, a load board that matches trucks to available loads, said its index for spot market demand fell sharply from August to September, to the lowest point since February. ‚Äö√Ñ√∫A large part of that is that we‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve seen inventory builds earlier in the year than we traditionally have seen because of all the supply-chain disruptions and the desire of a lot of retailers to get ahead of that.‚Äö√Ñ√π

Freight executives say demand remains solid by historical measures, suggesting shipping markets are reaching some equilibrium after sharp swings in business during the pandemic.

"When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Enphase Energy is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). 

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.","Zacks users have recently been watching Enphase Energy (ENPH) quite a bit.

"EXCLUSIVE Boeing shores up Defense unit leadership after delays. 

Addressing the nuts and bolts of BDS is significant not only because of immediate pressures but because its work on advanced new design methods is expected to shape future civil jetliner programs at Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA). In 2006, incoming BCA chief Scott Carson appointed Jim Jamieson chief operating officer of the planemaking unit - a wide brief giving him effective oversight of jet manufacturing and development until his retirement about 18 months later.

Jamieson's manufacturing muscle was seen at the time as a counterweight to Carson's sales and financial background after the departure of revered jetliner chief Alan Mulally to Ford.

Those changes came just as Boeing was trying to juggle changes in manufacturing with the development of the Boeing 787, while still bearing the wounds of a 1997 production crisis.

Boeing is once again involved in a radical overhaul of design and manufacturing methods, using digital modelling rooted in the development of the T-7A military trainer. Boeing has deferred a possible decision on launching a pair of new civil jets by around two years amid debts and questions over the timing of new production systems and engine technology.","Boeing Co has appointed a senior troubleshooter to help turn around loss-making programs at its Defense, Space & Security (BDS) division in what some sources view as a potential template for future efforts to fix wider industrial woes.",BA,11/16/2022 0:00,positive

"In the wake of the Taylor Swift ticket sales disaster that left scores of fans empty-handed or price-gouged, the Senate Judiciary Committee began questioning a series of witnesses on Tuesday to determine whether Live Nation, Ticketmaster‚Äö√Ñ√¥s parent company, wields a monopoly over the concert-going industry and should be dismantled.

‚Äö√Ñ√∫Let‚Äö√Ñ√¥s take the Taylor Swift fiasco as an example,‚Äö√Ñ√π Jerry Mickelson, an independent concert promoter and the co-founder of Jam Productions, said at the hearing when asked why it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s so difficult for the average consumer to buy concert tickets.

‚Äö√Ñ√∫The fans had to sign up through a Verified Fan [service] to even buy a ticket,‚Äö√Ñ√π Mickelson said. I think that it was driven by Ticketmaster‚Äö√Ñ√¥s bottom line in the Taylor Swift fiasco.‚Äö√Ñ√π

Antitrust complaints against Ticketmaster have been going on long before the company cancelled its main sale for Swift tickets last year, resulting in hundreds of thousands of snubbed fans‚Äö√Ñ√ÆPearl Jam leveled a complaint against the company in 2004. Joe Berchtold, president and CFO of Live Nation Entertainment, began his address to members of the committee by stating that his company‚Äö√Ñ√¥s system is ‚Äö√Ñ√∫best in class,‚Äö√Ñ√π but went on to claim that the problems encountered by Swift fans when they were attempting to buy tickets were largely due to bot attacks.

‚Äö√Ñ√∫In hindsight there are several things we could have done better,‚Äö√Ñ√π Berchtold said. ‚Äö√Ñ√∫And let me be clear, Ticketmaster accepts its responsibility as being the first line in defense against bots in our industry.‚Äö√Ñ√π

Sen. Marsha Blackburn expressed frustration that Live Nation evidently wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t handling bots with more skill. Other issues that were brought up during the hearing had to do with purchasing event tickets, such as massive hidden fees of up to 82 percent on top of ticket prices, as well as speculative ticket sales, in which resellers sell tickets that they technically don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t have yet to secondary buyers at hugely inflated sums.

Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal later scoffed at what he deemed to be Ticketmaster‚Äö√Ñ√¥s attempts to place the blame for the Eras Tour debacle on Swift herself, who was not present at the hearing.","‚Äö√Ñ√∫Ticketmaster ought to look in the mirror and say, ‚Äö√Ñ√≤I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m the problem, it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s me,‚Äö√Ñ√¥‚Äö√Ñ√π one senator said during the hearing examining the company‚Äö√Ñ√¥s dominance in the concert industry.",LYV,11/17/2022 0:00,positive

Keep in mind: Like smoking, vaping is addictive because e-cigarettes contain nicotine, the same addictive ingredient that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s in cigarettes.
‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ The Biden administration‚Äö√Ñ√¥s FDA has been cracking down on the industry. Goldman Sachs analyst Bonnie Herzog wrote Friday that the move to terminate the non-compete is ""very positive"" for Altria, noting that the company can now pursue revenue from vaping while also retaining its stake in Juul, thus potentially capitalizing on any potential upside if Juul takes a turn for the better. 

The other side: ‚Äö√Ñ√∫This decision gives us more flexibility as it increases the financial and strategic options we can pursue to secure our business and address the impact of the FDA‚Äö√Ñ√¥s now stayed order,‚Äö√Ñ√π Juul said in a statement, adding that the company is ‚Äö√Ñ√∫confident‚Äö√Ñ√π in its ability to meet the FDA‚Äö√Ñ√¥s requirements to get back onto the market.
‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ Nelson, however, said he‚Äö√Ñ√¥s skeptical that Juul will reemerge as a competitor in the U.S.: ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Most analysts are looking at it as a fairly low probability because this administration is cracking down on tobacco more than the prior administration.‚Äö√Ñ√π

What‚Äö√Ñ√¥s next: If Altria decides to go the acquisition route, expect the company to target vaping businesses that have already obtained preliminary FDA approval to sell and market their products under the new regulatory regime that Juul has failed to navigate, Nelson says.

"Lawmakers bash Southwest over flight cancellations. 

Lawmakers are hammering Southwest Airlines over its spate of flight cancellations in recent days after a cold front blew in freezing temperatures and snow across broad swaths of the country during the holidays. 

While several airlines faced high levels of cancellations, Southwest canceled at least 70% of its flights Monday due to the weather and a reported system meltdown.

A care provider has been ordered to pay $521,905 in back pay to its employees, after the Department of Labor found it had engaged in ""wage theft"" after it ""willfully denied"" overtime pay.""

Phoenix-based Urgent Home Care Inc. was found to have broken the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), after an investigation by the department's Wage and Hours Division.

The back pay order was given by the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, which also imposed a fine of $24,222 for repeat violations. 

In a statement, Wage and Hour Division District Director Eric Murray, said: ""Urgent Home Care has again been found violating the rights of workers who provide essential services to people in need. 

""The court's order and the outcome of our investigation send the clear message that the U.S. Department of Labor will use its enforcement powers to recover workers' hard-earned wages and hold those who deliberately engage in wage theft accountable.""

Urgent Home Care Inc. was found to have committed similar rule breaches during a separate investigation in 2016.

Under the court order, Urgent Home Care is also banned from taking retaliatory action against any employees who raised complaints and must avoid further breaches of FLSA regulations.

Murray said that companies that don't follow the rules are likely to have trouble holding on to workers, commenting: ""As employers continue to struggle to find the people they need to fill open positions, those who fail to respect workers' rights will find it harder to retain and recruit employees than employers who do.""

According to a report from the International Data Corporation (IDC), 'the consequence of this increasing reliance on data will be a never-ending expansion in the size of the Global Datasphere.'

The report shows the estimated zettabytes (ZB), a measure of digital storage capacity, in 2019 was just 45ZB, but by 2025 that is set to increase to 175ZB.

One zettabyte is equivalent to a trillion gigabytes.

"Trucking companies are pinning hopes for a rebound in freight demand on the second half of this year, saying their retailer customers expect to resume restocking after winding down inventories over recent months.

Carrier executives say they are hearing from their shipping customers that they expect to return to a more normal ordering cycle this year and start moving bigger volumes closer to the fall shopping season following volatile retail spending and distribution in 2022 that left them overstocked.

‚Äö√Ñ√∫The general consensus, almost unanimous, from customers that have given us feedback about their inventories has been that by the time they get through the spring, things are caught up,‚Äö√Ñ√π David Jackson, president and chief executive of trucking giant Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc., said on an investor conference call Jan. 26. Freight movement on U.S. roads, rails and through ports has slowed since the middle of 2022, cutting off a boom in shipping during the pandemic as retailers rushed goods through logistics networks to meet strong consumer demand. The falloff began as U.S. consumers shifted their spending last year toward services rather than goods and rising inflation dampened demand at stores, leaving big retailers including Walmart Inc., Target Corp. and Kohl‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Corp. with warehouses swamped with unsold merchandise.

‚Äö√Ñ√∫Trucking is definitely down right now,‚Äö√Ñ√π said Tom Nightingale, CEO of AFS Logistics, a Shreveport, La.-based logistics operator. ‚Äö√Ñ√π

This week, U.S., Swiss regulators took over Silicon Valley Bank and Swiss officials stepped in to shore up the finances of Credit Suisse, and a group of Wall Street firms threw a lifeline to First Republic Bank. The events are likely to cause banks to tighten up their lending, putting added pressure on already strained consumers to pull back on spending and trigger layoffs at companies facing declining sales. Consumers have largely been able to keep increasing their spending, while retail sales declined slightly in February compared to January.

The percentage of credit card holders carrying debt from month to month has increased to 46%, up from 39% a year ago.
