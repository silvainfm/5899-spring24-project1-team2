# Project Summary
We wanted to build a long/short portfolio based on sentiment from articles. For that we used the Finbert model and a gpt model. 
While training the models on the data we got the stock prices from yahoo finance to add to our data. 
Once we got the sentiment based on those articles, we designed a strategy to buy or sell a stock based on the sentiment and its score. 
We incorporated proper risk management in our strategy. 

# Our Approach
## Data collection
Data from excel, then used the yahoo finance API to get the stocks' returns data.
